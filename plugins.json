The pages are stored locally on the system where LiteSpeed server software is installed and are not transferred to or accessed by LiteSpeed employees in any way, except as necessary in providing routine technical support if you request it. All cache files are temporary, and may easily be purged before their natural expiration, if necessary, via a Purge All command. It is up to individual site administrators to come up with their own cache expiration rules.</p>\n<p>In addition to caching, our WordPress plugin has online features provided by QUIC.cloud for Image Optimization, CSS Optimization and Low Quality Image Placeholder services. When one of those optimizations are requested, data is transmitted to a remote QUIC.cloud server, processed, and then transmitted back for use on your site. Now if using the QUIC.cloud CDN it uses LSCache technologies to access your site then host your site to others globally and also your data is not transferred to or accessed by QUIC.cloud employees in any way, except as necessary in providing maintenance or technical support. QUIC.cloud keeps copies of that data for up to 7 days and then permanently deletes them. Similarly, the WordPress plugin has a Reporting feature whereby a site owner can transmit an environment report to LiteSpeed so that we may better provide technical support. None of these features collects any visitor data. Only server and site data are involved.</p>\n<p>Please see the <a href=\"https://quic.cloud/privacy-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">QUIC.cloud Privacy Policy</a> for our complete Privacy/GDPR statement.</p>\n",

      "description": "<h3>WordPress Mail SMTP Plugin</h3>\n<p>Is your WordPress site not sending emails? You&#8217;re not alone. 3+ million websites use WP Mail SMTP to send emails reliably.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to make email deliverability easy so that your emails always reach the inbox.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP fixes your email deliverability issues by reconfiguring WordPress to use a proper SMTP provider when sending emails.</p>\n<p>Best of all, our easy-to-use Setup Wizard and detailed documentation guide you through the process.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP is free and has everything you need to reliably send your WordPress emails!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>WP Mail SMTP Pro</strong></a> unlocks even more powerful features like email logging, advanced email reporting and stats, backup connections, email alerts, smart conditional routing, and much more.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WP Mail SMTP Overview\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYJuPyiKKZc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h4>What is SMTP?</h4>\n<p>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry-standard for sending emails. Proper SMTP configuration helps increase email deliverability by adding authentication to the emails sent from your site.</p>\n<p>Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, Office 365, and Zoho are in a constant battle with email spammers, so they check whether emails are originating from a genuine sender. If the proper authentication isn&#8217;t there, emails either go in the SPAM folder or, worse, disappear.</p>\n<p>This is a problem for a lot of WordPress sites. By default, WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact form plugin like <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/?utm_source=wprepo-wpmailsmtp&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPForms</a>.</p>\n<p>But most <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress hosting companies</a> don&#8217;t have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.</p>\n<p>This is why WordPress emails aren‚Äôt delivered.</p>\n<h4>How does WP Mail SMTP work?</h4>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin easily resolves email delivery problems by changing the way your WordPress site sends email. We reconfigure the <code>wp_mail()</code> function to use proper SMTP host credentials or an SMTP mail provider.</p>\n<p>With our built-in SMTP mail provider integrations (recommended), emails are sent using the provider&#8217;s direct API. Even if your web host is blocking SMTP ports, your emails will still be sent successfully.</p>\n<p>This helps you fix all <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/wordpress-not-sending-email/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress not sending email</a> issues.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin includes many different SMTP mailers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>SendLayer <strong>(#1 Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>SMTP.com <strong>(Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) SMTP <strong>(Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>Gmail SMTP (Gmail, Google Workspace, G Suite)</li>\n<li>Elastic Email</li>\n<li>Mailgun SMTP</li>\n<li>Mailjet SMTP</li>\n<li>SendGrid SMTP</li>\n<li>Postmark SMTP</li>\n<li>SparkPost SMTP</li>\n<li>SMTP2GO</li>\n<li>Microsoft SMTP One-Click Setup (Outlook.com and Office 365) <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Amazon SES SMTP <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Zoho Mail SMTP <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Other SMTP</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For most options, you can specify the &#8220;from name&#8221; and &#8220;email address&#8221; for outgoing emails too.</p>\n<p>All of these powerful features make WP Mail SMTP the best SMTP solution for WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know which mailer to choose, see our <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/docs/a-complete-guide-to-wp-mail-smtp-mailers/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Complete Guide to WP Mail SMTP Mailers</a>.</p>\n<h4>SendLayer</h4>\n<p>SendLayer is our #1 recommended transactional email service.</p>\n<p>Its affordable pricing and simple setup make it the perfect choice for sending emails from WordPress.

      "description": "<p>Redirection is the most popular redirect manager for WordPress. With it you can easily manage 301 redirections, keep track of 404 errors, and generally tidy up any loose ends your site may have. This can help reduce errors and improve your site ranking.</p>\n<p>Redirection is designed to be used on sites with a few redirects to sites with thousands of redirects.</p>\n<p>It has been a WordPress plugin for over 10 years and has been recommended countless times. And it&#8217;s free!</p>\n<p>Full documentation can be found at <a href=\"https://redirection.me\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://redirection.me</a></p>\n<p>Redirection is compatible with PHP from 7.0 to 8.3.</p>\n<h4>Redirect manager</h4>\n<p>Create and manage redirects quickly and easily without needing Apache or Nginx knowledge. If your WordPress supports permalinks then you can use Redirection to redirect any URL.</p>\n<p>There is full support for regular expressions so you can create redirect patterns to match any number of URLs. You can match query parameters and even pass them through to the target URL.</p>\n<p>The plugin can also be configured to monitor when post or page permalinks are changed and automatically create a redirect to the new URL.</p>\n<h4>Conditional redirects</h4>\n<p>In addition to straightforward URL matching you can redirect based on other conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Login status &#8211; redirect only if the user is logged in or logged out</li>\n<li>WordPress capability &#8211; redirect if the user is able to perform a certain capability</li>\n<li>Browser &#8211; redirect if the user is using a certain browser</li>\n<li>Referrer &#8211; redirect if the user visited the link from another page</li>\n<li>Cookies &#8211; redirect if a particular cookie is set</li>\n<li>HTTP headers &#8211; redirect based on a HTTP header</li>\n<li>Custom filter &#8211; redirect based on your own WordPress filter</li>\n<li>IP address &#8211; redirect if the client IP address matches</li>\n<li>Server &#8211; redirect another domain if also hosted on this server</li>\n<li>Page type &#8211; redirect if the current page is a 404</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Full logging</h4>\n<p>A configurable logging option allows to view all redirects occurring on your site, including information about the visitor, the browser used, and the referrer. A &#8216;hit&#8217; count is maintained for each redirect so you can see if a URL is being used.</p>\n<p>Logs can be exported for external viewing, and can be searched and filtered for more detailed investigation.</p>\n<p>Display geographic information about an IP address, as well as a full user agent information, to try and understand who the visitor is.</p>\n<p>You are able to disable or reduce IP collection to meet the legal requirements of your geographic region, and can change the amount of information captured from the bare minimum to HTTP headers.</p>\n<p>You can also log any redirect happening on your site, including those performed outside of Redirection.</p>\n<h4>Add HTTP headers</h4>\n<p>HTTP headers can be added to redirects or your entire site that help reduce the impact of redirects or help increase security. You can also add your own custom headers.</p>\n<h4>Track 404 errors</h4>\n<p>Redirection will keep track of all 404 errors that occur on your site, allowing you to track down and fix problems.</p>\n<p>Errors can be grouped to show where you should focus your attention, and can be redirected in bulk.</p>\n<h4>Query parameter handling</h4>\n<p>You can match query parameters exactly, ignore them, and even pass them through to your target.</p>\n<h4>Migrate Permalinks</h4>\n<p>Changed your permalink structure? You can migrate old permalinks simply by entering the old permalink structure. Multiple migrations are supported.</p>\n<h4>Apache &amp; Nginx support</h4>\n<p>By default Redirection will manage all redirects using WordPress. However you can configure it so redirects are automatically saved to a .htaccess file and handled by Apache itself.</p>\n<p>If you use Nginx then you can export redirects to an Nginx rewrite rules file.</p>\n<h4>Fine-grained permissions</h4>\n<p>Fine-grained permissions are available so you can customise the plugin for different users. This makes it particularly suitable for client sites where you may want to prevent certain actions, and remove functionality.</p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export</h4>\n<p>The plugin has a fully-featured import and export system and you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Import and export to Apache .htaccess</li>\n<li>Export to Nginx rewrite rules</li>\n<li>Copy redirects between sites using JSON</li>\n<li>Import and export to CSV for viewing in a spreadsheet</li>\n<li>Use WP CLI to automate import and export</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also import from the following plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple 301 Redirects</li>\n<li>SEO Redirection</li>\n<li>Safe Redirect Manager</li>\n<li>Rank Math</li>\n<li>WordPress old slug redirects</li>\n<li>Quick Post/Pages redirects</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Search Regex compatible</h4>\n<p>Redirection is compatible with <a href=\"https://searchregex.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Search Regex</a>, allowing you to bulk update your redirects.</p>\n<h4>Wait, it&#8217;s free?</h4>\n<p>Yes, it&#8217;s really free. There&#8217;s no premium version and no need to pay money to get access to features. This is a dedicated redirect management plugin.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>Please submit bugs, patches, and feature requests to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/johngodley/redirection\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/johngodley/redirection</a></p>\n<p>Please submit translations to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/redirection\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/redirection</a></p>\n",

No need to edit your theme files!</p>\n<p>Aside from Header and Footer scripts, you can also use WPCode to insert custom PHP code snippets, JavaScript code snippets, CSS code snippets, HTML code snippets, and text snippets with full conditional logic support.</p>\n<p>We took the pain out of adding custom code snippets in WordPress and made it easy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have been using Insert Headers and Footers and it is such a useful tool.

This includes smart conditional logic, saving code snippets to cloud library, code revisions, page-specific snippets, deeper integration with popular plugins like WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, and so much more. <a href=\"https://wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to purchase the best premium WordPress code snippet plugin now!</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Future Proof Code Snippet Management</h4>\n<p>Most <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/category/wp-tutorials/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress tutorial websites</a> ask you to add code snippets to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file. This makes managing code snippets messy, and it also prevents you from updating your theme.</p>\n<p>If you ever update your theme or switch to another theme, then you will lose all custom code functions that you added in your functions.php file.</p>\n<p>WPCode solves this by providing you an easy way to insert header and footer scripts along with other code snippets directly from your WordPress dashboard. These code snippets actually run as if they were in your theme&#8217;s functions.php file.</p>\n<p>Our smart code snippet validation helps you prevent common code errors to ensure you never break your website when adding code snippets or header and footer scripts.</p>\n<p><strong>New WPCode Cloud Library</strong> even allows you to store all your custom code snippets in a cloud library, so you can easily re-use code snippets across multiple website projects and save time. You can keep your code snippets completely private or <a href=\"https://library.wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">share it with the community</a> to give back while boosting your social profile.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This plugin allows me to not only add things to my site whenever needed, but it takes me only seconds to accomplish it.<br />\n  David Weber &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Full Code Snippets Library and Code Generators</h4>\n<p>Ever wanted a central place to find all the most popular WordPress code snippets that are tested and proven to work?</p>\n<p>When we started Insert Headers and Footers plugin, we did too. So we built a WordPress code snippets library right inside the WPCode plugin.</p>\n<p>You will find verified PHP code snippets for popular feature requests like disable REST API, disable XML-RPC, disable comments, allow SVG file uploads, disable Gutenberg, add Classic Editor, and more without installing separate plugins for each.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was very hesitant to get into any of the code for my website. Your plugin made it easy for me to do.<br />\n  Conbrio75 &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We also built the ability to save your code snippets to <a href=\"https://library.wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPCode Cloud Library</a>, so you can easily re-use it on your other websites, client projects, or even share it with the larger community.</p>\n<p>WPCode Cloud Library helps you better organize your code snippets in one central location, so you can save more time and speed up your workflow when managing websites. No more wasting time looking for custom notes or Github gists.</p>\n<p>Aside from our growing code snippets library, we also have WordPress code generators to help you quickly get ready-to-use custom code using the latest WordPress coding standards and API&#8217;s.</p>\n<h4>Conditional Logic for Code Snippets + Code Insertion Priority</h4>\n<p>Our goal with WPCode was to create a WordPress code snippets plugin that&#8217;s both EASY and POWERFUL.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why aside from our global header and footer scripts, we added advanced features like conditional logic for code snippets and made it easy.</p>\n<p>Instead of learning WordPress conditional logic queries, you can use our beginner-friendly conditional logic user interface to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Load code snippets for logged in users only</li>\n<li>Load PHP code snippets for specific user roles</li>\n<li>Load PHP code snippets only on specific page URLs</li>\n<li>Insert header and footer pixel scripts on specific pages</li>\n<li>Show code snippets based on type of page</li>\n<li>Run code snippet only on certain post types</li>\n<li>Load header and footer code snippet based on referrer source</li>\n<li>and more&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also added both automatic code insertion and manual code output using shortcodes.</p>\n<p>Our Auto Insert feature allows you to run the code snippet everywhere or choose from custom options like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run code snippet only on frontend</li>\n<li>Run code snippet only in WordPress admin area</li>\n<li>Add header and footer scripts sitewide</li>\n<li>Insert PHP code snippet before or after post content</li>\n<li>Insert code snippet before or after specific paragraph</li>\n<li>Insert code snippet on specific archive pages</li>\n<li>Insert code snippets after specific WooCommerce function (<a href=\"https://wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro Feature</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aside from that, we also added a visual code snippet priority system, so you can choose the order for your custom functions to avoid code conflict.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is such a useful plugin!

You can even load code snippets based on device type such as mobile only code snippets, desktop only code snippets, etc.</p>\n<h4>Import and Export Code Snippets</h4>\n<p>Managing multiple websites or developing in a staging environment?</p>\n<p>We offer an easy way to import and export your custom code snippets, functions, and header and footer scripts to help you save time.</p>\n<p>You can also save your code snippets to WPCode Cloud (Pro feature), so you can easily re-use the same code snippets across multiple websites.

      "description": "<h4>English</h4>\n<p><em>WPS Hide Login</em> is a very light plugin that lets you easily and safely change the url of the login form page to anything you want. It doesn‚Äôt literally rename or change files in core, nor does it add rewrite rules. It simply intercepts page requests and works on any WordPress website. The wp-admin directory and wp-login.php page become inaccessible, so you should bookmark or remember the url. Deactivating this plugin brings your site back exactly to the state it was before.</p>\n<p>This plugin is kindly proposed by <a href=\"https://www.wpserveur.net/?refwps=14&amp;campaign=wpshidelogin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPServeur</a> the specialized WordPress web host.</p>\n<p>Discover also our other free extensions:<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wps-limit-login/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPS Limit Login</a> to block brute force attacks.<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wps-bidouille/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPS Bidouille</a> to optimize your WordPress and get more info.<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wps-cleaner/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPS Cleaner</a> to clean your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This plugin is only maintained, which means we do not guarantee free support.

Il ne renomme pas litt√©ralement ou ne modifie pas les fichiers dans le noyau, ni n&#8217;ajoute des r√®gles de r√©√©criture. Il intercepte simplement les demandes de pages et fonctionne sur n&#8217;importe quel site WordPress. Le r√©pertoire wp-admin et la page wp-login.php deviennent inaccessibles, vous devez donc ajouter un signet ou vous souvenir de l&#8217;URL. D√©sactiver ce plugin ram√®ne votre site exactement √† l&#8217;√©tat dans lequel il √©tait auparavant.</p>\n<p>Ce plugin vous est gentiment propos√© par <a href=\"https://www.wpserveur.net/?refwps=14&amp;campaign=wpshidelogin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPServeur</a> l&#8217;h√©bergeur sp√©cialis√© WordPress.</p>\n<p>Plus d&#8217;infos sur son utilisation : <a href=\"https://wpformation.com/wps-hide-login-url-connexion-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://wpformation.com/wps-hide-login-url-connexion-wordpress/</a></p>\n<p>D√©couvrez √©galement nos autres extensions gratuites :<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/wps-limit-login/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPS Limit Login</a> pour bloquer les attaques par force brute.<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/wps-bidouille/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPS Bidouille</a> pour optimiser votre WordPress et faire le plein d&#8217;infos.<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/wps-cleaner/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPS Cleaner</a> pour nettoyer votre site WordPress.</p>\n<p>Ce plugin est seulement maintenu, ce qui signifie que nous ne garantissons pas un support gratuit.

All login related things such as the registration form, lost password form, login widget and expired sessions just keep working.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs also compatible with any plugin that hooks in the login form, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BuddyPress,</li>\n<li>bbPress,</li>\n<li>Jetpack,</li>\n<li>WPS Limit Login,</li>\n<li>and User Switching.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously it doesn‚Äôt work with plugins or themes that <em>hardcoded</em> wp-login.php.</p>\n<p>Works with multisite, with subdomains and subfolders. Activating it for a network allows you to set a networkwide default. Individual sites can still rename their login page to something else.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre using a <strong>page caching plugin</strong> other than WP Rocket, you should add the slug of the new login url to the list of pages not to cache. WP Rocket is already fully compatible with the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Fran√ßais</h4>\n<p>N√©cessite WordPress 4.1 ou sup√©rieur. Toutes les choses li√©es √† la connexion telles que le formulaire d&#8217;inscription, le formulaire de mot de passe perdu, le widget de connexion et les sessions expir√©es continuent de fonctionner.</p>\n<p>Il est √©galement compatible avec tout plugin qui se connecte au formulaire de connexion, notamment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BuddyPress,</li>\n<li>bbPress,</li>\n<li>Jetpack,</li>\n<li>WPS Limit Login,</li>\n<li>and User Switching.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>√âvidemment, cela ne fonctionne pas avec les plugins ou les th√®mes <em>hardcoded</em> wp-login.php.</p>\n<p>Fonctionne en multisite, avec sous-domaines ou sous dossiers. L&#8217;activer pour un r√©seau vous permet de d√©finir une valeur par d√©faut pour l&#8217;ensemble du r√©seau. Les sites individuels peuvent toujours renommer leur page de connexion pour autre chose.</p>\n<p>Si vous utilisez un <strong>plugin de mise en cache de pages</strong> autre que WP Rocket, vous devez ajouter le slug de la nouvelle URL de connexion √† la liste des pages √† ne pas mettre en cache.

      "short_description": "A very fast caching engine for WordPress that produces static html files.",
      "description": "<p>This plugin generates static html files from your dynamic WordPress blog.  After a html file is generated your webserver will serve that file instead of processing the comparatively heavier and more expensive WordPress PHP scripts.</p>\n<p>The static html files will be served to the vast majority of your users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users who are not logged in.</li>\n<li>Users who have not left a comment on your blog.</li>\n<li>Or users who have not viewed a password protected post.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>99% of your visitors will be served static html files. One cached file can be served thousands of times. Other visitors will be served custom cached files tailored to their visit. If they are logged in, or have left comments those details will be displayed and cached for them.</p>\n<p>The plugin serves cached files in 3 ways (ranked by speed):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Expert. The fastest method is by using Apache mod_rewrite (or whatever similar module your web server supports) to serve &#8220;supercached&#8221; static html files. This completely bypasses PHP and is extremely quick. If your server is hit by a deluge of traffic it is more likely to cope as the requests are &#8220;lighter&#8221;. This does require the Apache mod_rewrite module (which is probably installed if you have custom permalinks) and a modification of your .htaccess file which is risky and may take down your site if modified incorrectly.</li>\n<li>Simple. Supercached static files can be served by PHP and this is the recommended way of using the plugin. The plugin will serve a &#8220;supercached&#8221; file if it exists and it&#8217;s almost as fast as the mod_rewrite method. It&#8217;s easier to configure as the .htaccess file doesn&#8217;t need to be changed. You still need a custom permalink. You can keep portions of your page dynamic in this caching mode.</li>\n<li>WP-Cache caching. This is mainly used to cache pages for known users, URLs with parameters and feeds. Known users are logged in users, visitors who leave comments or those who should be shown custom per-user data. It&#8217;s the most flexible caching method and slightly slower. WP-Cache caching will also cache visits by unknown users if supercaching is disabled. You can have dynamic parts to your page in this mode too. This mode is always enabled but you can disable caching for known users, URLs with parameters, or feeds separately. Set the constant &#8220;DISABLE_SUPERCACHE&#8221; to 1 in your wp-config.php if you want to only use WP-Cache caching.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not comfortable with editing PHP files then use simple mode. It&#8217;s easy to set up and very fast.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Settings</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Simple caching.</li>\n<li>Compress pages.</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t cache pages for known users.</li>\n<li>Cache rebuild.</li>\n<li>CDN support.</li>\n<li>Extra homepage checks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Garbage collection is the act of cleaning up cache files that are out of date and stale. There&#8217;s no correct value for the expiry time but a good starting point is 1800 seconds.</p>\n<p>Consider deleting the contents of the &#8220;Rejected User Agents&#8221; text box and allow search engines to cache files for you.</p>\n<p>Preload as many posts as you can and enable &#8220;Preload Mode&#8221;. Garbage collection of old cached files will be disabled. If you don&#8217;t care about sidebar widgets updating often set the preload interval to 2880 minutes (2 days) so all your posts aren&#8217;t recached very often. When the preload occurs the cache files for the post being refreshed is deleted and then regenerated. Afterwards a garbage collection of all old files is performed to clean out stale cache files.<br />\nEven with preload mode enabled cached files will still be deleted when posts are modified or comments made.</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Active development of this plugin is handled <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on GitHub</a>.</li>\n<li>Translation of the plugin into different languages is on the <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-super-cache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">translation page</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>If you need more information than the following, you can have a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the wiki</a> or the <a href=\"https://odd.blog/wp-super-cache-developers/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Developer documentation</a>.</p>\n<h4>Preloading</h4>\n<p>You can generate cached files for the posts, categories and tags of your site by preloading. Preloading will visit each page of your site generating a cached page as it goes along, just like any other visitor to the site. Due to the sequential nature of this function, it can take some time to preload a complete site if there are many posts.<br />\nTo make preloading more effective it can be useful to disable garbage collection so that older cache files are not deleted. This is done by enabling &#8220;Preload Mode&#8221; in the settings. Be aware however, that pages will go out of date eventually but that updates by submitting comments or editing posts will clear portions of the cache.</p>\n<h4>Garbage Collection</h4>\n<p>Your cache directory fills up over time, which takes up space on your server. If space is limited or billed by capacity, or if you worry that the cached pages of your site will go stale then garbage collection has to be done. Garbage collection happens on a regular basis and deletes old files in the cache directory. On the advanced settings page you can specify:<br />\n1. Cache timeout. How long cache files are considered fresh for. After this time they are stale and can be deleted.<br />\n2. Scheduler. Setup how often garbage collection should be done.<br />\n3. Notification emails. You can be informed on garbage collection job progress.<br />\nThere&#8217;s no right or wrong settings for garbage collection. It depends on your own site.<br />\nIf your site gets regular updates, or comments then set the timeout to 1800 seconds, and set the timer to 600 seconds.<br />\nIf your site is mostly static you can disable garbage collection by entering 0 as the timeout, or use a really large timeout value.</p>\n<p>The cache directory, usually wp-content/cache/ is only for temporary files. Do not ever put important files or symlinks to important files or directories in that directory. They will be deleted if the plugin has write access to them.</p>\n<h4>CDN</h4>\n<p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is usually a network of computers situated around the world that will serve the content of your website faster by using servers close to you. Static files like images, Javascript and CSS files can be served through these networks to speed up how fast your site loads. You can also create a &#8220;poor man&#8217;s CDN&#8221; by using a sub domain of your domain to serve static files too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ossdl-cdn-off-linker/\" rel=\"ugc\">OSSDL CDN off-linker</a> has been integrated into WP Super Cache to provide basic CDN support. It works by rewriting the URLs of files (excluding .php files) in wp-content and wp-includes on your server so they point at a different hostname. Many CDNs support <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22origin+pull%22\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">origin pull</a>. This means the CDN will download the file automatically from your server when it&#8217;s first requested, and will continue to serve it for a configurable length of time before downloading it again from your server.</p>\n<p>Configure this on the &#8220;CDN&#8221; tab of the plugin settings page. This is an advanced technique and requires a basic understanding of how your webserver or CDNs work. Please be sure to clear the file cache after you configure the CDN.</p>\n<h4>REST API</h4>\n<p>There are now REST API endpoints for accessing the settings of this plugin. You&#8217;ll need to be authenticated as an admin user with permission to view the settings page to use it. This has not been documented yet but you can find all the code that deals with this in the &#8220;rest&#8221; directory.</p>\n<h4>Custom Caching</h4>\n<p>It is now possible to hook into the caching process using the add_cacheaction() function.</p>\n<p>Three hooks are available:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8216;wp_cache_get_cookies_values&#8217; &#8211; modify the key used by WP Cache.</li>\n<li>&#8216;add_cacheaction&#8217; &#8211; runs in phase2. Allows a plugin to add WordPress hooks.</li>\n<li>&#8216;cache_admin_page&#8217; &#8211; runs in the admin page. Use it to modify that page, perhaps by adding new configuration options.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is one regular WordPress filter too. Use the &#8220;do_createsupercache&#8221; filter<br />\nto customize the checks made before caching. The filter accepts one parameter.<br />\nThe output of WP-Cache&#8217;s wp_cache_get_cookies_values() function.</p>\n<p>WP Super Cache has its own plugin system. This code is loaded when WP Super Cache loads and can be used to change how caching is done. This is before most of WordPress loads so some functionality will not be available. Plugins can be located anywhere that PHP can load them. Add your own plugin either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>by putting your plugin in the wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache-plugins directory, or</li>\n<li>by calling wpsc_add_plugin( $name ) where $name is the full filename and path to the plugin. You only need to call that function once to add it. Use wpsc_delete_plugin( $name ) to remove it from the list of loaded plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cookies WP Super Cache uses to identify &#8220;known users&#8221; can be modified now by adding the names of those cookies to a list in the plugin configuration. Use wpsc_add_cookie( $name ) to add a new cookie, and wpsc_delete_cookie( $name ) to remove it. The cookie names also modify the mod_rewrite rules used by the plugin but I recommend using Simple mode caching to avoid complications with updating the .htaccess file.<br />\nThe cookie name and value are used to differenciate users so you can have one cookie, but different values for each type of user on your site for example. They&#8217;ll be served different cache files.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/blob/4cda5c0f2218e40e118232b5bf22d227fb3206b7/plugins/searchengine.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugins/searchengine.php</a> as an example I use for my <a href=\"https://odd.blog/no-adverts-for-friends/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">No Adverts for Friends</a> plugin.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<p>If things don&#8217;t work when you installed the plugin here are a few things to check:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is wp-content writable by the web server?</li>\n<li>Is there a wp-content/wp-cache-config.php ? If not, copy the file wp-super-cache/wp-cache-config-sample.php to wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and make sure WPCACHEHOME points at the right place.</li>\n<li>Is there a wp-content/advanced-cache.php ? If not, then you must copy wp-super-cache/advanced-cache.php into wp-content/. You must edit the file and change the path so it points at the wp-super-cache folder.</li>\n<li>If pages are not cached at all, remove wp-content/advanced-cache.php and recreate it, following the advice above.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure the following line is in wp-config.php and it is ABOVE the &#8220;require_once(ABSPATH.&#8217;wp-settings.php&#8217;);&#8221; line:</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'WP_CACHE', true );\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Try the Settings-&gt;WP Super Cache page again and enable cache.</li>\n<li>Look in wp-content/cache/supercache/. Are there directories and files there?</li>\n<li>Anything in your php error_log?</li>\n<li>If your browser keeps asking you to save the file after the super cache is installed you must disable Super Cache compression. Go to the Settings-&gt;WP Super Cache page and disable it there.</li>\n<li>The plugin does not work very well when PHP&#8217;s safe mode is active. This must be disabled by your administrator.</li>\n<li>If pages are randomly super cached and sometimes not, your blog can probably be viewed with and without the &#8220;www&#8221; prefix on the URL. You should choose one way and install the <a href=\"http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/enforce-www-preference/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Enforce www preference</a> plugin if you are using an old WordPress install. The latest versions redirect themselves (you should always be running the latest version of WordPress anyway!)</li>\n<li>Private Server users at Dreamhost should edit wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and set the cache dir to &#8220;/tmp/&#8221; if they are getting errors about increasing CPU usage. See this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/145895?replies=42\" rel=\"ugc\">discussion</a> for more.</li>\n<li>File locking errors such as &#8220;failed to acquire key 0x152b: Permission denied in&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Page not cached by WP Super Cache. Could not get mutex lock.&#8221; are a sign that you may have to use file locking. Edit wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and uncomment &#8220;$use_flock = true&#8221; or set $sem_id to a different value. You can also disable file locking from the Admin screen as a last resort.</li>\n<li>Make sure cache/wp_cache_mutex.lock is writable by the web server if using coarse file locking.</li>\n<li>The cache folder cannot be put on an NFS or Samba or NAS share. It has to be on a local disk. File locking and deleting expired files will not work properly unless the cache folder is on the local machine.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Garbage collection of old cache files won&#8217;t work if WordPress can&#8217;t find wp-cron.php. If your hostname resolves to 127.0.0.1 it could be preventing the garbage collection from working. Check your access_logs for wp-cron.php entries. Do they return a 404 (file not found) or 200 code? If it&#8217;s 404 or you don&#8217;t see wp-cron.php anywhere WordPress may be looking for that script in the wrong place. You should speak to your server administator to correct this or edit /etc/hosts on Unix servers and remove the following line. Your hostname must resolve to the external IP address other servers on the network/Internet use. See http://yoast.com/wp-cron-issues/ for more. A line like &#8220;127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain&#8221; is ok.</p>\n<pre><code>127.0.0.1 example.com\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>If old pages are being served to your visitors via the supercache, you may be missing Apache modules (or their equivalents if you don&#8217;t use Apache). 3 modules are required: mod_mime, mod_headers and mod_expires. The last two are especially important for making sure browsers load new versions of existing pages on your site.</li>\n<li>The error message, &#8220;WP Super Cache is installed but broken. The path to wp-cache-phase1.php in wp-content/advanced-cache.php must be fixed!&#8221; appears at the end of every page. Open the file wp-content/advanced-cache.php in your favourite editor. Is the path to wp-cache-phase1.php correct? This file will normally be in wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache/. If it is not correct the caching engine will not load.</li>\n<li>Caching doesn&#8217;t work. The timestamp on my blog keeps changing when I reload. Check that the path in your .htaccess rules matches where the supercache directory is. You may have to hardcode it. Try disabling supercache mode.</li>\n<li>\n<p>If supercache cache files are generated but not served, check the permissions on all your wp-content/cache/supercache folders (and each of wp-content cache and supercache folders) and wp-content/cache/.htaccess. If your PHP runs as a different user to Apache and permissions are strict Apache may not be able to read the PHP generated cache files. To fix you must add the following line to your wp-config.php (Add it above the WP_CACHE define.) Then clear your cache.</p>\n<pre><code>umask( 0022 );\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you see garbage in your browser after enabling compression in the plugin, compression may already be enabled in your web server. In Apache you must disable mod_deflate, or in PHP zlib compression may be enabled. You can disable that in three ways. If you have root access, edit your php.ini and find the zlib.output_compression setting and make sure it&#8217;s &#8220;Off&#8221; or add this line to your .htaccess:</p>\n<pre><code>php_flag zlib.output_compression off\n</code></pre>\n<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work, add this line to your wp-config.php:</p>\n<pre><code>ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 0);\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>The &#8220;white screen of death&#8221; or a blank page  when you visit your site is almost always caused by a PHP error but <a href=\"http://www.johnberns.com/2010/03/19/wp-super-cache-blank-page-problem-fixed/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">it may also be caused by APC</a>. Disable that PHP extension if you have trouble and replace with eAccelerator or Xcache.</li>\n<li>After uninstalling, your permalinks may break if you remove the WordPress mod_rewrite rules too. Regenerate those rules by visiting the Settings-&gt;Permalink page and saving that form again.</li>\n<li>If your blog refuses to load make sure your wp-config.php is correct. Are you missing an opening or closing PHP tag?</li>\n<li>Your front  &hellip;</li>\n</ol>\n",

It provides detailed information on how to optimize each aspect of your site and maximizes your website performance and cache.</p>\n<h3>CACHING</h3>\n<p>The Caching page gives you full control of your website‚Äôs cache, allowing you to enhance its performance significantly. Take advantage of the powerful caching options available to boost your page speed:</p>\n<h4>DYNAMIC CACHING:</h4>\n<p>By enabling Dynamic Caching, all non-static resources of your website are intelligently cached, eliminating the need for repetitive database queries and enhancing page loading speed and TTFB (time to first byte). This default feature is available exclusively for SiteGround servers, ensuring optimal performance.</p>\n<h4>FILE-BASED CACHING:</h4>\n<p>By activating file-based caching, your website generates and stores static HTML versions, ensuring faster loading times and an improved user experience. This efficient caching method stores the cached files conveniently in the browser&#8217;s memory, allowing future visitors to access your site swiftly and seamlessly.</p>\n<h4>MEMCACHED:</h4>\n<p>Unleash the power of object caching for your WordPress website. Memcached revolutionizes website performance by storing frequently executed queries to your databases and reusing them for lightning-fast website results. This powerful feature is exclusively available in the SiteGround environment.</p>\n<h4>CACHING SETTINGS:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automatic Cache Purge:</strong> ensure the cache is cleared whenever necessary</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Cache Purge:</strong> purge cache manually if you are editing new material and do not have automatic purge activated.</li>\n<li><strong>Browser-specific Caching:</strong> generate caching separately for different browsers</li>\n<li><strong>Exclude Post Types from Caching:</strong> exclude specific post types from being cached</li>\n<li><strong>Exclude URLs from Caching:</strong> exclude specific URLs or utilize wildcards to exclude any sub-pages of a designated &#8220;parent-page.&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Test URL Caching Status:</strong> verify if dynamic caching is actively running on specific URLs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>ENVIRONMENT OPTIMIZATIONS</h3>\n<p>Optimize and fine-tune your site&#8217;s environment for optimal website performance:</p>\n<h4>HTTPS Enforce:</h4>\n<p>Ensure a secure browsing experience for your visitors by effortlessly enabling HTTPS for your site. Say goodbye to insecure content errors and build trust with your audience.</p>\n<h4>Scheduled Database Maintenance:</h4>\n<p>Take control of your database by activating the Database Optimization feature. This functionality removes unnecessary items and optimizes your database tables, leading to improved efficiency and website performance. If you&#8217;re using the InnoDB storage engine, table optimisation is automatically handled by the engine itself.</p>\n<h4>Heartbeat Control:</h4>\n<p>Manage the frequency of the WP Heartbeat for different areas of your website. By default, the WordPress Heartbeat API checks for scheduled tasks every 15 seconds on post edit pages and every 60 seconds on the dashboard and front end. With Heartbeat Control, you can adjust the frequency of these checks or even disable them entirely, providing you with greater control over resource allocation.</p>\n<h3>FRONTEND OPTIMIZATIONS</h3>\n<p>Enhance and fine-tune the performance of your website&#8217;s front end by minifying JS, HTML and CSS:</p>\n<h4>CSS Tab:</h4>\n<p>Minify CSS files, activate or deactivate CSS combinations to reduce server requests, and even preload combined CSS for optimized performance. Additionally, you can exclude specific styles from being combined or minified, giving you complete control over your CSS optimization.</p>\n<h4>JavaScript Tab:</h4>\n<p>Activate or deactivate Minify JavaScript Files to reduce script sizes and lower the number of server requests. You can also defer render-blocking JavaScript to expedite the initial page speed. Furthermore, you have the ability to exclude specific scripts from various optimisation processes, providing flexibility in optimizing your JavaScript resources.</p>\n<h4>General Tab:</h4>\n<p>Further optimization options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Web Fonts Optimization:</strong> Enhance the loading of Google fonts by adding a preconnect link in your head tag. This informs the browser to establish a connection to Google&#8217;s font repository as quickly as possible. Additionally, all other local fonts will be preloaded, resulting in faster caching and rendering. When combined with CSS Combination, we also modify the font-display property to improve rendering speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Fonts Preloading:</strong> With locally hosted fonts being preloaded, you‚Äôre allowing browsers to cache and render them at an accelerated pace.</li>\n<li><strong>Remove Query Strings from Static Resources:</strong> Improve caching efficiency by removing query strings from static resources, optimizing their caching capabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Disable Emojis:</strong> Prevent WordPress from detecting and generating emojis on your pages by disabling emojis support. This helps boost your page speed and improve your website performance.</li>\n<li><strong>DNS Pre-fetch for External Domains:</strong> Enabling the DNS Pre-fetch for a domain will resolve it before resources from it get requested making those resources load faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>MEDIA OPTIMIZATIONS</h3>\n<p>Optimize your website media by reducing image size by up to 85% times while maintaining top-notch quality.</p>\n<h4>Image Compression:</h4>\n<p>Effortlessly compress images to resize your existing images and reduce the space they occupy on your server. The dimensions of the images will remain unchanged, allowing for optimized storage. Fine-tune the compression level and choose whether to create backups of the original images. Please note that image compression feature is exclusive to the SiteGround Environment.</p>\n<h4>WebP Images:</h4>\n<p>Leverage the power of WebP, a cutting-edge image format supported by modern browsers, to significantly reduce the size of your images and skyrocket your page speed. If a browser doesn&#8217;t support WebP, the original images will be loaded.</p>\n<h4>Lazy Load Media:</h4>\n<p>Take control of your website&#8217;s asset loading with the ability to enable or disable Lazy Load for various assets. You can exclude specific assets such as iframes, videos, thumbnails, widgets, and shortcodes from the dropdown menu. Additionally, you have the option to exclude specific images from the Lazy Load by adding their respective class in the dedicated tab.</p>\n<h4>Maximum Image Width:</h4>\n<p>If you frequently upload large images to your website, you can enable the Maximum Image Width option that automatically resizes existing and future images whose width exceeds 2560 pixels. By optimizing image sizes, you can enhance your website performance and reduce bandwidth usage.<br />\nYou can customize your media optimisation to your specific needs using the filters, we‚Äôve designed for this purpose.</p>\n<h3>SPEED TEST</h3>\n<p>Evaluate the optimization level of your website with Speed Optimizer‚Äôs Speed test tool. Our website performance check utilizes the robust capabilities of Google PageSpeed to provide comprehensive insights into your site&#8217;s optimization. By conducting the speed test, you will receive detailed results highlighting areas that can be further optimized for enhanced performance. These insights will empower you to fine-tune your website and unlock its maximum potential and increase conversions.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p>In order to work correctly, this plugin requires that your server meets the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.7</li>\n<li>PHP 7.0+</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our plugin uses a cookie in order to function properly. It does not store personal data and is used solely for the needs of our caching system.</p>\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\n<p>Collection of technical data is optional and is <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/kb/what-information-wp-plugins-collect\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">listed here</a>. This data is collected only for technical analysis, improvements and the possibility to contact the plugin user in case urgent issues need to be fixed (for example a critical security release that needs to be communicated to site owners). The plugin user can manage their preferences within the WP admin to control the collection of technical data. We advise opting in for this data collection, as it can enhance the plugin&#8217;s performance. You may find more information on data collection in our <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/viewtos/siteground_plugins_privacy_notice\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugins Privacy Notice</a>.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p>Photo credits to Anna Shvets https://www.pexels.com/@shvetsa</p>\n",

      "description": "<p><strong>Upload SVG files to your media library securely, with built-in sanitization and advanced features for styling and animation.</strong></p>\n<p>SVG Support goes beyond just enabling SVG uploads. It offers powerful features that make working with SVGs easier and more flexible.</p>\n<p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are a staple in modern web design, allowing you to embed images with small file sizes that scale perfectly at any size without losing quality. However, styling and animating SVGs can be challenging when using standard methods. SVG Support simplifies this by allowing you to render your SVGs inline, enabling direct styling and animation using CSS and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>This plugin provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SVG Upload Support</strong>: Easily upload SVG files to your media library.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic Sanitization</strong>: All SVG uploads are sanitized by default to ensure security.</li>\n<li><strong>Minification Options</strong>: Reduce SVG file sizes with optional minification.</li>\n<li><strong>Inline Rendering</strong>: Render SVG code inline by adding the <code>\"style-svg\"</code> class to your images, making the elements within your SVGs directly targetable for styling and animation.</li>\n<li><strong>Role-Based Upload Control</strong>: Restrict SVG upload capabilities to specific user roles.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom Target Class</strong>: Define a custom CSS class for targeting SVGs, which can be applied to outer elements for greater flexibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Full SVG support in your media library</li>\n<li>Automatic sanitization for secure SVG uploads</li>\n<li>Optional minification for smaller SVG file sizes</li>\n<li>Role-based upload restrictions</li>\n<li>Inline SVG rendering for easy styling and animation</li>\n<li>Custom target class support for flexible SVG handling</li>\n<li>Simple and intuitive settings page with clear instructions</li>\n<li><strong>Extremely Simple to Use &#8211; Simplifies complex SVG file handling</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Installation</strong>: Install and activate SVG Support (this plugin) through your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Basic Usage</strong>: Once activated, you can upload SVG files to your media library like any other image file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Admin Settings</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigate to &#8220;Settings &gt; SVG Support&#8221; in your WordPress admin dashboard.</li>\n<li>Restrict SVG file uploads to specific user roles, such as Administrators.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Advanced Mode</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you only need to upload SVG files as static images, you don‚Äôt need to enable &#8220;Advanced Mode&#8221;. This keeps the plugin lightweight by not enqueuing unnecessary scripts.</li>\n<li><strong>For Advanced Use</strong>: Enable &#8220;Advanced Mode&#8221; to access additional features such as minification and inline rendering.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inline SVG Rendering</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With Advanced Mode enabled, you can embed SVG images by adding the <code>\"style-svg\"</code> class (or a custom class you‚Äôve defined) to your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags.</li>\n<li>Example:<br />\n<code>&lt;img class=\"style-svg\" alt=\"alt-text\" src=\"image-source.svg\" /&gt;</code><br />\nor<br />\n<code>&lt;img class=\"your-custom-class\" alt=\"alt-text\" src=\"image-source.svg\" /&gt;</code></li>\n<li>The plugin dynamically replaces the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element with the actual SVG code, making the SVG‚Äôs internal elements targetable by CSS and JavaScript.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Custom Target Classes</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can set a custom class to target for inline rendering.</li>\n<li>You can add the target class to outer elements if you cannot directly add it to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. The plugin will traverse the element‚Äôs children to find and replace the SVG.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Auto-Class Insertion (Classic Editor)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable the setting to automatically add your target class to SVG images when inserting them into posts or pages. This also removes unnecessary attributes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inline Rendering</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since version 2.3.11, you can force all SVG files sitewide to be rendered inline with a single checkbox (use with caution).</li>\n<li>You can choose between the minified or expanded version of the JS file for inline rendering.</li>\n<li>You can choose between the jQuery or vanilla JS file for inline rendering.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Featured Images</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you save a post/page with an SVG as the featured image, a checkbox will appear in the featured image meta box to allow you to render the SVG inline (only available if Advanced Mode is active).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: If your SVG isn‚Äôt displaying correctly, it might be due to 0 height and width. Set your SVG‚Äôs dimensions in your CSS to ensure proper display.</p>\n<p><em>For any issues, please use the support tab, and I will do my best to assist you quickly.</em></p>\n<h3>Spin up a test site</h3>\n<p>With a single click, you can spin up a completely free test site to test SVG Support using TasteWP!

SVG Support provides several features to help mitigate these risks and ensure secure handling of SVG files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sanitization by default: Starting from version 2.5.8, all SVG uploads are sanitized by default to remove any potentially malicious code.</li>\n<li>Role-Based Upload Restrictions: You can restrict SVG uploads to specific user roles, ensuring only trusted users can upload these files.</li>\n<li>Optional Bypass of Sanitization: You have the option to allow certain roles to bypass the sanitization process, though this should be used with caution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important: Only allow users you trust to upload SVG files. By default, anyone with Media Library access or the <code>upload_files</code> capability (e.g., Administrators, Authors, Editors) can upload SVGs. Remember, SVG files are XML-based, meaning they can contain malicious code if not properly sanitized. Always configure your settings to balance functionality with security.</p>\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m open to your <a href=\"mailto:&#x77;&#112;&#064;&#x62;&#x65;&#110;b&#x6f;&#100;&#104;&#x69;&#x2e;&#099;&#111;&#x6d;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">suggestions and feedback</a> &#8211; Thanks for using SVG Support!</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/svgsupport\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@SVGSupport</a> on Twitter<br />\nFollow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benbodhi\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@benbodhi</a> on Twitter<br />\nFollow <a href=\"https://warpcast.com/benbodhi\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@benbodhi</a> on Warpcast</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> I hope you like this plugin!

All major performance testing solutions, including Google PageSpeed Insights, assess your site&#8217;s ability to serve images in these next-gen formats due to the significant impact on visitor experience.</p>\n<p><strong>WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPG images</strong>. More information can be found in <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/webp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this Google developers article</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The best part:</strong> Smush&#8217;s Local WebP feature makes this incredibly easy to set up with the ability to host all images locally (not requiring the use of a CDN).

Smush strips hidden information from your images (that can often be bulky), and reduces image file sizes without introducing a visible impact on appearance.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZJGq4zwf1A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>Smush meticulously scans every image you upload &#8211; or have already added to your site &#8211; cuts all the unnecessary data, and scales it for you before adding it to your media library. And it can serve images in the WebP format.</p>\n<h3>Compress Images While You Sleep With Background Image Optimization</h3>\n<p>Have a large number of images to compress? Smush‚Äôs powerful optimization features will continue to work their magic in the background, even when you‚Äôve closed the plugin completely. You‚Äôll receive an email when image optimization has been completed &#8211; with a full report.</p>\n<h3>Compress Any Image in Any Directory</h3>\n<p>As well as smushing your media uploads, you may want to compress the images stored in other folders. Smush now lets you compress any image in any directory &#8211; so that you can optimize all the images on your site &#8211; including <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/\" rel=\"ugc\">NextGEN</a> images, images stored on Amazon S3 using <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Offload Media</a> and images in EVERY WordPress plugin and theme package!</p>\n<h3>Compatible with Your Favorite Themes, Page Builders, and Media Library Plugins</h3>\n<p>No matter what theme or plugins you use to manage your WordPress media library, Smush has you covered.

It caches your site</strong></p>\n<p>Caching is the process of storing a temporary HTML version of your site on the server so it can be retrieved more quickly for the user.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a sure-fire way to ensure web pages load at lightning-fast speed. Turn it on in just one click.</p>\n<p><strong>2. It compresses images</strong></p>\n<p>Large images can really impact page speed load times. WP-Optimize makes it easy to identify and compress images to your preferred lossy / lossless settings in a couple of clicks.</p>\n<p><strong>3. It cleans the database</strong></p>\n<p>Your WordPress database stores everything that you need, plus some things that you don&#8217;t. WP-Optimize cleans and optimizes the database to speed up your site and save server resources.</p>\n<p><strong>4. It minifies</strong></p>\n<p>On top of its three main features, WP-Optimize Cache also has the more advanced minification feature.</p>\n<p>Together with caching, minification dramatically improves performance and page speed load time.</p>\n<h3>1. CACHE YOUR SITE</h3>\n<p><strong>Turn on caching in just one click:</strong></p>\n<p>WP-Optimize automatically and optimally configures itself for your WordPress site. Turn it on in one-click or refine its settings if you prefer.</p>\n<p><strong>More cache features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cache preloading:</strong> This feature emulates a visit to your site, meaning cached files are served straight away, speeding up your site from the very first visit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GZIP Compression:</strong> When the server isn&#8217;t configured to do so, WP-Optimize delivers HTML, CSS and JS files  to the user&#8217;s browser as smaller, compressed files, reducing the size of pages and style sheets by up to 90%!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preload key requests:</strong> Recommended by Google to improve page speed times. Critical resources (things like font files) get loaded first, so the page loads much faster <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use cache settings to:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Serve cached content to logged in users:</strong> Turn this on if content stays the same for logged in users (or turn on and exclude URLs where content does change e.g. my account areas).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exclude content from cache:</strong> Exclude by URL, conditional tags, browser agent strings or list cookies that should prevent caching when set (advanced user settings).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deliver device-specific cache:</strong> Serve separate cache files to desktop and mobile devices . This ensures that responsive features e.g. desktop and mobile menus are cached separately and served correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User per role cache:</strong> Useful if your website delivers different content to different user roles. e.g. an e-commerce site that displays different content to resellers or consumers <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User specific cache:</strong> Serves separate cache files to individual users. Useful for websites with personalised content e.g. Learning management systems <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cache purging permissions:</strong> Select which user roles are allowed to purge the cache e.g. admin only or perhaps a &#8216;teacher&#8217; role in an LMS setting only <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. COMPRESS IMAGES</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lossy or lossless compression options:</strong> Choose between maximum space saving, best image quality or somewhere in-between.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>WebP conversion:</strong> Recommended by Google, WebP can achieve up to 34% smaller file sizes compared to JPEG and up to 26% compared to PNG.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Auto-compress:</strong> Check a box and every new image you upload will automatically be compressed to your preferred lossy / lossless settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bulk compression:</strong> Compress every existing image on your site with the press of a button.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Restore original:</strong> Gone too far? Revert images back to their original in one click.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Retain EXIF image data:</strong> Check a box to retain EXIF image data during compression.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lazy Load:</strong> Webpages load much faster by loading web parts gradually, when they&#8217;re needed vs simultaneous loading of everything, all at once <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delete orphaned images:</strong> Identify and delete unused images from your WordPress website, saving disk space <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delete unused image sizes:</strong> WordPress creates multiple sizes for every uploaded image causing the uploads folder to become bloated. Scan for image sizes not in use and remove them to save further disk space <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. CLEAN AND OPTIMIZE THE DATABASE</h3>\n<p>Cleans-up database tables, post revisions, auto draft posts, trashed posts, spam, trashed comments and more. Choose what to optimize or it&#8217;s one click to clean out the lot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Schedule clean-ups:</strong> So you can set and forget. Choose from daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible clean-up schedules:</strong> You may wish to optimize database tables more frequently than you remove unapproved comments (for example). Choose the specific time and day when tasks should run <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Retain a set number of weeks&#8217; data during clean-ups:</strong> Just in case you need to retrieve something.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Back up before clean-ups:</strong> If you delete something you shouldn&#8217;t, restore it in a couple of clicks with UpdraftPlus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Power tweak &#8211; Turbo boost for WooCommerce:</strong>  Unique to WP-Optimize, this power tweak boosts performance by replacing a slow query in WooCommerce with two much more efficient queries. E-commerce sites transacting high numbers of orders stand to gain here <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Power tweak &#8211; Boost performance by indexing the postmeta table:</strong> This unique power tweak works by allowing the WordPress postmeta table to be indexed, improving performance <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. MINIFY AND COMBINE HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Minify in just one click:</strong> Minifies HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Toggle on or off or customise each one under &#8216;settings&#8217;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customise minification:</strong> Minify only (removing unnecessary code e.g line breaks and white spacing) or minify and merge. Apply the same or different settings to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Asynchronous loading:</strong> Choose non-critical CSS and JavaScript files to load in the background and independently of other resources e.g. analytics or pixel scripts. Loading asynchronously eliminates render blocking and improves page speed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exclude files from being minified:</strong> Specify CSS and JavaScript files to exclude from minification.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimize fonts:</strong> Optimize Font Awesome and Google Fonts. Inline the font files, inherit from CSS settings or load CSS / Javascript asynchronously instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preload assets:</strong> WP-Optimize visits each web page on your site so the code is minified and preloaded for real life users, right from their very first visit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preload key requests:</strong> Recommended by Google to improve page speed times. Critical resources (things like font files) get loaded first, so the page loads much faster.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WHY WP-OPTIMIZE?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s brought to you by UpdraftPlus, the team behind the world&#8217;s most trusted backup, migration and restoration plugin.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s easy to use.</li>\n<li>It packs a punch for a free plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WP-Optimize brings the best cache and optimization technology together into one single, seamless plugin to make your WordPress site fast, lean and efficient.</p>\n<h3>PREMIUM FEATURES AT A GLANCE</h3>\n<p>Our free version of WP-Optimize Cache is great, but we also have an even more powerful Premium version with extra features that offer the ultimate in freedom and flexibility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multisite Support:</strong> extends database optimisations so they function for multiple WordPress sites at a time. If you manage more than one website, you will need WP-Optimize Cache Premium.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility and Control:</strong> gives you the power to optimize select individual tables or a particular combination of tables on one or more WordPress websites, rather than having to optimize all database tables.</li>\n<li><strong>Deleting unused and unwanted images:</strong> removes orphaned images from your WordPress site, plus images of a certain, pre-defined size.</li>\n<li><strong>Sophisticated Scheduling:</strong> offers a wide range of options for scheduling automatic optimization. Specify an exact time and run clean-ups daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly and perform any number of additional once off optimizations.</li>\n<li><strong>Seamless Graphical User Interface:</strong> for superb clarity in scheduling and managing of multi-site optimizations.</li>\n<li><strong>WP-CLI support:</strong> provides a way to manage optimizations from command-line interface if you have lots of sites</li>\n<li><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> load only the images and part of a web-page when it is visible to the user so they can see something very quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimization Preview:</strong> gives users the ability to preview, select and remove data and records available for optimization from the database.</li>\n<li><strong>Preload key requests:</strong> preload assets such as web fonts and icon fonts, as recommended by Google PageSpeed Insights.</li>\n<li><strong>Premium support</strong> &#8211; caching is one of the most complex things you can do for a website, so premium support offers you peace of mind there&#8217;s someone to talk quickly to if you need any technical answers or help configuring the optimizations of cache settings for your website.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>Translators are welcome to contribute to the plugin.

      "description": "<p>Regenerate Thumbnails allows you to regenerate all thumbnail sizes for one or more images that have been uploaded to your Media Library.</p>\n<p>This is useful for situations such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new thumbnail size has been added and you want past uploads to have a thumbnail in that size.</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve changed the dimensions of an existing thumbnail size, for example via Settings √¢¬Ü¬í Media.</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve switched to a new WordPress theme that uses featured images of a different size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It also offers the ability to delete old, unused thumbnails in order to free up server space.</p>\n<h4>In Memory of Alex Mills</h4>\n<p>In February 2019 Alex Mills, the author of this plugin, <a href=\"https://alex.blog/2019/02/27/from-alexs-family/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">passed away</a>. He leaves behind a number of plugins which will be maintained by Automattic and members of the WordPress community. If this plugin is useful to you please consider donating to the Oregon Health and Science University. You can find more information <a href=\"https://alex.blog/2019/03/13/in-memory-of-alex-donation-link-update/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p><strong>WP-CLI</strong></p>\n<p>If you have command line access to your server, I highly recommend using <a href=\"https://wp-cli.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP-CLI</a> instead of this plugin as it&#8217;s faster (no HTTP requests overhead) and can be run inside of a <code>screen</code> for those with many thumbnails. For details, see the documentation of its <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/media/regenerate/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>media regenerate</code> command</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Jetpack&#8217;s Photon Module</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Jetpack</a> is a plugin by Automattic, makers of WordPress.com. It gives your self-hosted WordPress site some of the functionality that is available to WordPress.com-hosted sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/photon/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The Photon module</a> makes the images on your site be served from WordPress.com&#8217;s global content delivery network (CDN) which should speed up the loading of images. Importantly though it can create thumbnails on the fly which means you&#8217;ll never need to use this plugin.</p>\n<p>I personally use Photon on my own website.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for Automattic but I would recommend Photon even if I didn&#8217;t.</em></p>\n<h4>Need Help?

Our comprehensive features are specifically designed to strengthen your website&#8217;s defenses against malware, exploits, and various malicious activities. With these tools at your disposal, you can ensure the utmost bot, malware and brute force protection for your website:</p>\n<h4>Lock and Protect System Folders</h4>\n<p>Ensure the maximum security for your application&#8217;s system folders by preventing the execution of any unauthorized or malicious scripts. The Lock and Protect System Folders feature acts as a powerful shield against potential threats.</p>\n<h4>Hide WordPress Version</h4>\n<p>Protect your website from mass attacks by hiding the WordPress version, which helps to mitigate version-specific vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h4>Disable Themes &amp; Plugins Editor</h4>\n<p>Enhance the security of your WordPress admin area by disabling the Themes &amp; Plugins Editor, preventing potential coding errors and unauthorized access through the editor.</p>\n<h4>Disable XML-RPC</h4>\n<p>Mitigate potential security risks by disabling the XML-RPC protocol, which has been exploited in various attacks. Please note that disabling XML-RPC will restrict WordPress from communicating with third-party systems. We recommend enabling this feature unless you have a specific need for it.</p>\n<h4>Disable RSS and ATOM Feeds</h4>\n<p>Prevent content scraping and specific attacks on your site by disabling RSS and ATOM feeds. Unless you have readers accessing your site via RSS readers, it is recommended to keep this feature enabled.</p>\n<h4>Advanced XSS Protection</h4>\n<p>Add an extra layer of website security against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by enabling Advanced XSS Protection, bolstering the overall security of your website.</p>\n<h4>Delete Default Readme.html</h4>\n<p>Eliminate potential vulnerabilities by deleting the default readme.txt file, which contains information about your website. By removing this file, you reduce the risk of your site being listed in vulnerable sites targeted by hackers.</p>\n<h3>Login Security</h3>\n<h4>Custom Login Url</h4>\n<p>Personalize your login URL to thwart potential attacks and create a strong entry point. Bid farewell to the default login URL and embrace a bespoke path of your choosing. Additionally, you have the freedom to modify the default sign-up URL as well.</p>\n<h4>Login Access</h4>\n<p>Restrict login page access to specific IP addresses or IP ranges, effectively thwarting malicious login attempts and deterring brute force attacks.</p>\n<h4>2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)</h4>\n<p>Immerse your website in an impenetrable shield of security with 2FA. This formidable feature demands that all admin users furnish a unique token, generated exclusively through the Google Authentication application, during the login process.</p>\n<h4>Disable Common Usernames</h4>\n<p>Don&#8217;t fall victim to predictable security breaches! The use of common usernames, such as &#8216;admin,&#8217; poses a significant threat to the integrity of your website. Activate this option to disable the creation of common usernames. If any weak usernames already exist, we&#8217;ll prompt you to provide new, stronger alternatives.</p>\n<h4>Limit Login Attempts</h4>\n<p>Maintain control over unauthorized access attempts with Limit Login Attempts. Set a specific threshold for the number of login failures users can endure before consequences arise. After reaching the limit, the IP address associated with the unsuccessful login attempts will be blocked for one hour. Persistent failures will result in longer restrictions, starting with 24 hours and escalating to a week.</p>\n<h3>ACTIVITY MONITORING</h3>\n<p>Monitor your website and login page for unauthorized visitors and brute force attempts to prevent malicious actions</p>\n<h4>Activity Log</h4>\n<p>The Activity Log page provides you with a comprehensive view of the activities performed by registered, unknown, and blocked visitors. It allows you to closely monitor any suspicious behavior and take appropriate actions in case of a compromised user, plugin, or hacking attempt. You can leverage the quick tools available to swiftly block future attempts.</p>\n<h4>Weekly Security Reports</h4>\n<p>Receive a weekly traffic summary for your website directly to your inbox. This <strong>Weekly Security Report</strong> compiles data on both bot and human traffic, along with details about blocked login and visit attempts to proactively monitor traffic and promptly identify suspicious activity.</p>\n<h3>POST-HACK ACTIONS</h3>\n<p>Take immediate measures to protect your website if you suspect a compromise and prevent further damage. Here, you&#8217;ll find convenient solutions to address the situation effectively:</p>\n<h4>Reinstall All Free Plugins</h4>\n<p>In the event of a hack, utilizing the Reinstall All Free Plugins feature can help mitigate potential harm. This action reinstalls all of your free plugins, reducing the likelihood of additional exploits or the reuse of malicious code.</p>\n<h4>Log Out All Users</h4>\n<p>To prevent any further unauthorized activities by users or attackers, you can choose to log out all users instantly using the Log Out All Users feature.</p>\n<h4>Force Password Reset</h4>\n<p>By enforcing a password reset, you can ensure that all users are prompted to change their passwords during their next login. This not only strengthens the security of their accounts but also immediately logs out all currently logged-in users.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.7</li>\n<li>PHP 7.0</li>\n<li>Working .htaccess file</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\n<p>Collection of technical data is optional and is <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/kb/what-information-wp-plugins-collect\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">listed here</a>. This data is collected only for technical analysis, improvements and the possibility to contact the plugin user in case urgent issues need to be fixed (for example a critical security release that needs to be communicated to site owners). The plugin user can manage their preferences within the WP admin to control the collection of technical data. We advise opting in for this data collection, as it can enhance the plugin&#8217;s performance.

But most importantly, make your visitors happier so they keep coming back for more.</p>\n<p>With EWWW IO you can optimize all your existing images, <a href=\"https://docs.ewww.io/article/84-plugin-compatibility\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">from any plugin</a>, and then let EWWW IO take care of new image uploads automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Why use EWWW Image Optimizer?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>No Speed Limits</strong> and <a href=\"https://ewww.io/unlimited-file-size/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">unlimited file size</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Smooth Handling</strong> with pixel-perfect optimization using industry-leading tools and progressive rendering.</li>\n<li><strong>High Torque</strong> as we bring you the best compression/quality ratio available with our Premium compression for JPG, PNG, SVG, WebP, and PDF files.</li>\n<li><strong>Adaptive Steering</strong> with intelligent conversion options to get the right image format for the job (JPG, PNG, GIF, AVIF, or WebP).</li>\n<li><strong>Free Parking</strong> The core plugin is free and always will be. However, our paid services offer up to 80% compression, and a <a href=\"https://ewww.io/plans/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">host of other features</a>!</li>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive Coverage:</strong> no image gets left behind, optimize everything on your site, not just the WordPress Media Library.</li>\n<li><strong>Safety First:</strong> all communications are secured with top SSL encryption.</li>\n<li><strong>Roadside Assistance:</strong> top-notch support is in our DNA. While API customers get top priority, we answer <a href=\"https://ewww.io/contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">every single support question with care</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Pack a Spare:</strong> free image backups store your original images for 30 days.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>EWWW IO is the only plugin that lets you optimize images using tools on your own server (jpegtran, optipng, pngout, pngquant, gifsicle, cwebp). If you feel the need for more speed, get more compression and offload the CPU-intensive process of optimization to <a href=\"https://ewww.io/plans/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our specialized servers</a>.</p>\n<h4>Automatic Everything</h4>\n<p>With Easy IO, images are automatically compressed, scaled to fit the page and device size, lazy loaded, and converted to next-gen WebP and AVIF formats.</p>\n<h4>Support</h4>\n<p>Stuck? Feeling like maybe you DO need that rocket science degree? <a href=\"https://ewww.io/contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">We provide free one-on-one email support to everyone</a>.<br />\nDo you have an idea to make EWWW IO even better? <a href=\"https://feedback.ewww.io/b/features\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Share it and vote on future features</a>!</p>\n<p>Found a bug? Report the issue on <a href=\"https://github.com/nosilver4u/ewww-image-optimizer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>, and we&#8217;ll get it fixed!</p>\n<p>You may report security issues through our Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team helps validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/ewww-image-optimizer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Report a security vulnerability.</a></p>\n<h4>Bulk Optimize</h4>\n<p>Optimize all your images from a single page. This includes the Media Library, your theme, and a handful of pre-configured folders (see Optimize Everything Else below). GRAND FlaGallery, NextCellent and NextGEN have their own Bulk Optimize pages.</p>\n<h4>Optimize Everything Else</h4>\n<p>Configure any folder within your WordPress install to be optimized. The Bulk Optimizer will compress theme images, BuddyPress avatars, BuddyPress Activity Plus images, Meta Slider slides, WP Symposium Pro avatars, GD bbPress attachments, Grand Media Galleries, and any user-specified folders. You can also use Scheduled optimization or run the optimizer from WP-CLI if that&#8217;s more your thing.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Compatibility</h4>\n<p>EWWW IO has been tested with hundreds (if not thousands) of <a href=\"https://docs.ewww.io/article/84-plugin-compatibility\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugins and themes</a>, here are just a few of the most common ones: BuddyPress (Activity Plus add-on too), Cloudinary, Easy Watermark, FileBird, FooGallery, GD bbPress Attachments, GRAND FlAGallery, Gmedia Photo Gallery, MediaPress, Meta Slider, Microsoft Azure Storage, MyArcadePlugin, NextGEN Gallery, Regenerate Thumbnails, <a href=\"https://weglot.com/integrations/wordpress-translation-plugin/demo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Weglot</a>, WP Offload Media, <a href=\"https://wpml.org/plugin/ewww-image-optimizer/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPML</a>, WP Retina 2x, WP RSS Aggregator, WP Symposium. <a href=\"https://docs.ewww.io/article/84-plugin-compatibility\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more&#8230;</a></p>\n<h4>WebP Images</h4>\n<p>If you want simple, get automatic WebP conversion with Easy IO, and be done with it! Otherwise, you can generate WebP versions of your images with the Bulk Optimizer, and deliver them to supported browsers. Take your pick between Apache-style rewrite rules, JS WebP Rewriting, and  WebP Rewriting. EWWW IO even works with the WebP option in the Cache Enabler plugin from KeyCDN.</p>\n<h4>AVIF Images</h4>\n<p>AVIF conversion is built into the Easy IO CDN. Once your site is setup with Easy IO, edit the site settings to enable AVIF, and you&#8217;re done!</p>\n<h4>WP-CLI</h4>\n<p>Allows you to run all Bulk Optimization processes from your command line, instead of the web interface. It is much faster, and allows you to do things like run it in &#8216;screen&#8217; or via regular cron (instead of wp-cron, which can be unpredictable on low-traffic sites). Install WP-CLI from wp-cli.org, and run &#8216;wp-cli.phar help ewwwio optimize&#8217; for more information or see the <a href=\"https://docs.ewww.io/article/25-optimizing-with-wp-cli\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>CDN Support</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Offload Media</a> is the officially supported (and recommended) plugin for uploads to Amazon S3, Digital Ocean Spaces, and Google Cloud Storage. <a href=\"https://docs.ewww.io/article/84-plugin-compatibility\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Check our compatibility list for details on other plugins</a>. All pull mode CDNs like Cloudflare, KeyCDN, MaxCDN, and Sucuri CloudProxy work automatically, but will require you to purge the cache after a bulk optimization.</p>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>Huge thanks to all our translators, <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/contributors\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">see the full list</a>!</p>\n<p>If you would like to help translate this plugin, <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/ewww-image-optimizer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">join the team</a>.<br />\n<a href=\"https://ewww.io/register/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Signup to receive updates when new strings are available for translation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p>Written by <a href=\"https://ewww.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shane Bishop</a> with special thanks to my <a href=\"https://www.iamsecond.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Lord and Savior</a>.

      "description": "<p><strong>Cookie Notice</strong> provides a simple, customizable website banner that can be used to help your website comply with certain cookie consent requirements under the EU GDPR cookie law and CCPA regulations and includes <strong>seamless integration</strong> with Cookie Compliance to help your site comply with the latest updates to existing consent laws.</p>\n<p><strong>Cookie Compliance</strong> is a fully featured Consent Management Platform (CMP) that provides automated compliance features and enhanced design controls in a state-of-the-art web application. Cookie Compliance enables websites to <strong>take a proactive approach to data protection and consent laws</strong>. It is the first solution to offer Intentional Consent, a new consent framework that incorporates the latest guidelines from over 100+ countries, and emerging standards from leading international organizations like the IEEE and European Center for Digital Rights (noyb.eu). Cookie Compliance provides a beautiful, multi-level experience and includes new choices and controls for site visitors to better understand and engage in data privacy decisions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our Cookie Compliance web application introduces a more ethical, proactive way to capture and manage consent.  This early version of the emerging Intentional Consent framework is a result of Hu-manity.co‚Äôs ongoing work with top Fortune 500 companies, governments, and standards organizations, who believe that the imbalanced relationship between consumers and corporations is unsustainable when it comes to data privacy and consent online. We are making it available for all website owners and operators who share this belief and support our mission to eliminate the dark patterns in online consent.<br />\n  Matt Sinderbrand &#8211; Chief Platform Officer, Hu-manity.co</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Cookie Notice (plugin only)</h3>\n<p>Cookie Notice provides a simple, customizable website banner to help your website comply with certain cookie consent requirements.</p>\n<h4>Banner features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Customizable notice message</li>\n<li>Consent on click, scroll or close</li>\n<li>Multiple cookie expiry options</li>\n<li>Link to Privacy Policy page</li>\n<li>WordPress Privacy Policy page synchronization</li>\n<li>WPML and Polylang compatible</li>\n<li>SEO friendly</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cookie Compliance (plugin + web application)</h3>\n<p>Cookie Compliance gives you access to the most up-to-date formatting guidelines and technical compliance requirements for over 100 countries and legal jurisdictions.</p>\n<h4>Banner features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intentional Consent</strong> provides 3 equal buttons to give site visitors the ability to accept none, some, or all cookies through packaged choices called Data Access Levels. Data Access Levels improve consent conversion and eliminate the dark pattern of deceptive, non-equal choices in the first layer. <em>Complies with equal choice principle prescribed under GDPR and other data protection laws.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Consent duration selector</strong> gives visitor control over how long their consent remains valid for your site.  <em>Enables your site to align with recent guidelines from EU Data Protection Authorities, which state that cookie consent should be valid for no longer than a period of 6 months.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Cookie purpose categories</strong> make it easy for website visitors to customize their consent by category. <em>Complies with affirmative, opt-in consent requirements prescribed under GDPR and other data protection laws.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Consent metrics</strong> displays the visitor&#8217;s consent record and a list of blocked / allowed 3rd parties directly in the expanded level of the banner. <em>Complies with latest guidance from EU Data Protection Authorities like CNIL (France) and ICO (UK). </em></li>\n<li><strong>Customizable Privacy Paper</strong> provides helpful information to improve visitor comprehension and understanding of the data sharing risks and benefits. Allows you to summarize core components of your sites privacy notice and <em>aligns with the informed principle prescribed by GDPR rules for valid consent capture. </em></li>\n<li><strong>Configurable Privacy Contact</strong> allows you to provide contact information for a business‚Äô data privacy admin, as well as helpful links to data subject request forms and other data privacy resources. <em>Aligns with the informed principle prescribed by GDPR rules for valid consent capture.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Web Application features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consent analytics dashboard</strong> shows event data for number of visits and provides a ‚Äútrust score‚Äù to help you track how site visitors are setting their consent. Make adjustments to your banner to improve your cookie acceptance rate and monitor progress via the consent activity graph.</li>\n<li><strong>Default configurations</strong> for GDPR, CCPA and more help to remove dark patterns and allow for quick and easy deployment of the consent banner without any guesswork. Customize the design of any default configuration to match the look and feel of your site.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic script blocking</strong> blocks all non-essential cookie scripts and iFrames by default and <em>complies with valid consent rules under GDPR and other data protection laws</em>; in order to be compliant, your site must record visitor consent before setting or sending cookies.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Consent Mode</strong> ensures that your website can still gather valuable insights and perform effectively while respecting users&#8217; privacy preferences by <em>dynamically adjusting the behavior of Google services according to user consent.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Facebook Consent Mode</strong> allows your website to <em>measure the impact of your ads on Facebook</em>, track website activities and conversions and automatically deliver ads to Facebook if the user has agreed to.</li>\n<li><strong>Consent record storage</strong> automatically stores a record of each consent and makes these records available for export. <em>Complies with proof-of-consent requirements prescribed under GDPR and other data protection laws.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Multilingual support</strong> automatically translates all banner text strings and allows you to provide custom translations for every text field to ensure visitors get a consistent consent experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Multidomain management</strong> allows you to manage additional Free or Professional domains under a single account and enables you to customize banner configuration and design for each domain independently.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cookie Compliance proactive approach:</h4>\n<p>For all businesses, the resources required to stay ahead of the latest regulations increases with the passage of each new law. With enforcement of compliance violations increasing daily, we believe it is critical for us as a trusted consent vendor to do everything in our power to help you stay ahead of these laws and remove the risk to your business</p>\n<p><strong>Cookie Compliance covers all current and upcoming regulations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>GDPR (EU)</li>\n<li>ePrivacy Directive (EU)</li>\n<li>ePrivacy Regulation (EU)</li>\n<li>PECR (UK)</li>\n<li>LGPD (Brazil)</li>\n<li>PIPEDA (Canada)</li>\n<li>PDPB (India)</li>\n<li>CCPA (California, US)</li>\n<li>VCDPA (Virginia, US)</li>\n<li>Colorado Privacy Act (US)</li>\n<li>CPRA (California, US)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cookie Compliance incorporates all recent formatting guidance:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)</li>\n<li>ICO (United Kingdom)</li>\n<li>CNIL (France)</li>\n<li>GPDP (Italy)</li>\n<li>BfDl (Germany)</li>\n<li>AEPD (Spain)</li>\n<li>European Center for Digital Rights (noyb.eu)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cookie Compliance targets dark patterns</strong></p>\n<p>Dark Patterns are user interface (UI) techniques that push site visitors to make decisions (such as agreeing to the installation of cookies on their devices) that they might not otherwise make. The most common Dark Pattern is the lack of an equal ‚Äúreject all‚Äù button on the first layer of the consent notice. Dark Patterns are explicitly banned under GDPR and other data protection laws.</p>\n<p>As a part of our proactive approach, Cookie Compliance is configured by default to prevent Dark Patterns through our unique Intentional Consent design.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Redux was built by developers for developers. We save you months if not years in your development time. Everything we do is to help innovation in the industry.</p>\n<h4>‚ô•Ô∏è What the Plugin does?</h4>\n<p>Redux is a simple, genuinely extensible, and fully responsive options framework for WordPress themes and plugins. Built on the WordPress Settings API; Redux supports many field types, custom error handling, custom fields &amp; validation types, and import/export functionality.</p>\n<p>But what does Redux actually DO? We don&#8217;t believe that theme and plugin developers should have to reinvent the wheel every time they start work on a project. Redux simplifies the development cycle by providing a streamlined, extensible framework for developers to build on. Through a simple, well-documented config file, third-party developers can build out an options panel limited only by their imagination in a fraction of the time it would take to build from the ground up!</p>\n<h4>üöÄ What fields does Redux offer?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Accordion</li>\n<li>ACE Editor</li>\n<li>Background</li>\n<li>Border</li>\n<li>Box Shadow</li>\n<li>Button Set</li>\n<li>Checkbox / Multi-Check</li>\n<li>Color (WordPress Native)</li>\n<li>Color Gradient</li>\n<li>Color Palette</li>\n<li>Color RGBA</li>\n<li>Color Scheme</li>\n<li>Content</li>\n<li>Custom Fonts</li>\n<li>Customizer</li>\n<li>Date</li>\n<li>Date/Time</li>\n<li>Dimensions (Height/Width)</li>\n<li>Divide (Divider)</li>\n<li>Editor (WordPress Native)</li>\n<li>Gallery (WordPress Native)</li>\n<li>Google Maps</li>\n<li>Icon Select</li>\n<li>Image Select (Patterns/Presets)</li>\n<li>Import/Export</li>\n<li>Info (Header/Notice)</li>\n<li>JS Button</li>\n<li>Link Color</li>\n<li>Media (WordPress Native)</li>\n<li>Metaboxes</li>\n<li>Multi Media</li>\n<li>Multi-Text</li>\n<li>Palette</li>\n<li>Password</li>\n<li>Radio (w/ WordPress Data)</li>\n<li>Raw (HTML/PHP/MarkDown)</li>\n<li>Repeater</li>\n<li>Section (Indent and Group Fields)</li>\n<li>Select (Select/Multi-Select w/ Select2 &amp; WordPress Data)</li>\n<li>Select Image</li>\n<li>Slider (Drag a Handle)</li>\n<li>Slides (Multiple Images, Titles, and Descriptions)</li>\n<li>Social Profiles</li>\n<li>Sortable (Drag/Drop Checkbox/Input Fields)</li>\n<li>Sorter (Drag/Drop Manager &#8211; Works great for content blocks)</li>\n<li>Spacing (Margin/Padding/Absolute)</li>\n<li>Spinner</li>\n<li>Switch</li>\n<li>Tabbed</li>\n<li>Taxonomy Metaboxes</li>\n<li>Text</li>\n<li>Textarea</li>\n<li>Typography</li>\n<li>User Profile Metaboxes</li>\n<p> * The most advanced typography module complete with preview, Google fonts, and auto-css output!</p>\n<li>User Profile Metaboxes</li>\n<li>Widget Areas (Classic Widgets only)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>üéâAdditional Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Full value escaping</li>\n<li>Required &#8211; Link visibility from parent fields.

You need to only specify the CSS selector to apply the CSS to (limited to certain fields).</li>\n<li>Compiler integration! A custom hook runs when any fields with the argument `compile =&gt; true` are changed.</li>\n<li>Field validation and sanitization</li>\n<li>Field and section disabling</li>\n<li>Oh, and did we mention a fully integrated Google Fonts setup that will make you so happy you&#8217;ll want to cry?</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>üëç BE A CONTRIBUTOR</h4>\n<p>If you want to help with translations, <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/redux-framework\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">go to the Translation Portal at translate.wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also contribute code via our <a href=\"https://github.com/reduxframework/redux-framework/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub Repository</a>.

      "description": "<h4>The Best Image Optimization Plugin For WordPress</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://imagify.io/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Imagify</a> is the most advanced image optimization plugin to help you resize and compress images.

The plugin lets you optimize images in one go with its asynchronous bulk optimization option. You can resize your images on the fly ‚Äì they will be automatically optimized at the best compression level. If needed, you can always restore your images to their original versions.</p>\n<p>On top of optimizing images, you‚Äôll choose the best AVIF and WebP converter plugin for WordPress. Imagify also converts your images to WebP and AVIF, the next-gen formats for lighter images that will speed up your WordPress site, improve user experience, and even SEO.

Speed up your WordPress site and improve Core Web Vitals thanks to Imagify‚Äôs state-of-the-art image optimization process.</p>\n<p>Our video explains why Imagify is the easiest image optimization plugin and shows how it makes your website faster thanks to lighter images.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZgMwWvUZFu4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h4>Resize and Compress Images Without Losing Quality</h4>\n<p>Imagify is a great image compressor and the ultimate solution to optimise images. You are able to resize and compress images from the most common image formats as well as PDF format. In case you have many images to optimize, you can also resize images in bulk thanks to our async bulk optimization option. In just one click, you will be able to compress multiple images super easily. Imagify compresses all your images in the background, so you can leave the page and not worry about anything.</p>\n<p>Many of your high-quality images may be in sizes that are much too large. To reduce image size and compress large images, Imagify has a setting that allows you to choose a maximum width for all of your images, and if you upload images that are larger than that size, it will resize large images for you during optimization. Imagify will resize images proportionally without cropping them.</p>\n<p>With such a great image optimizer like Imagify, you‚Äôll get your images automatically optimized at the best compression level and quality ‚Äì thanks to the Smart Compression Mode.</p>\n<p>When using our image compression tool, Imagify, you will enjoy smaller file sizes and faster loading times. But the best part is that you will optimise images and reduce their weight without losing quality: why should you have to choose between beauty and speed? If you want to compress images, it‚Äôs now easier than ever with Imagify!</p>\n<h4>Convert Images to the WebP and AVIF Formats</h4>\n<p>Thanks to Imagify, you can take a step further in your image optimization process. You can also convert all your images to next-gen image formats such as WebP and AVIF. WebP format, as well as the AVIF format, offers superior image compression and quality and is a way to optimise images and speed up their loading times on websites. By utilizing Imagify‚Äôs AVIF and WebP optimizer, you can efficiently convert images to these next-gen formats, saving you a precious amount of time.</p>\n<p>With Imagify, WebP conversion and compression are indeed super easy. Wondering how the convert WebP option works? Imagify will automatically enable WebP and convert your images to WebP. You can also easily convert WebP images to AVIF.</p>\n<p>If the &#8220;Create Next-gen formats versions&#8221; option is enabled, the AVIF version of optimized images will be created automatically. Simple as that! Thanks to the best WebP and AVIF plugin for WordPress, you‚Äôll be able to take advantage of the automatic convert WebP feature in no time, plus you‚Äôll always have the convert AVIF option.</p>\n<p>Imagify can also display the AVIF images directly on your front-end. But because some browser versions don‚Äôt support AVIF yet, Imagify lets you have both optimized versions of the original format images and the WebP versions ready. Imagify will serve the AVIF version if a visitor&#8217;s browser supports it and the WebP format if not (if you have previously converted the images to WebP).</p>\n<p>WebP is definitively an excellent replacement for jpeg, png, and gif images, and the same goes for AVIF, which improves your image performance even further. Imagify offers WebP conversion for all image formats: you can convert gif to WebP, jpeg to WebP, and even png to WebP. You can also benefit from AVIF conversion and convert gif to AVIF, jpg and jpeg to AVIF, png to AVIF, and even WebP to AVIF!<br />\nWhatever your favorite image format, let Imagify optimise your images!</p>\n<h4>Optimise Images to Make Your Site Faster and Improve Core Web Vitals</h4>\n<p>Did you know that image optimization and web performance go hand in hand? In fact, when it comes to web page speed, one of the first things you should do is optimize your images. Large and heavy image sizes will indeed slow down your website and provide a bad user experience to your visitors ‚Äì and that‚Äôs why you should compress images. On the contrary, when you optimise images and improve image loading speed, you should see a direct improvement in your website speed and performance. With Imagify, it‚Äôs time to say goodbye to images taking too long to load.</p>\n<p>Images are one of the largest influencing factors in the Core Web Vitals. Image compression will ensure your images load faster and improve your overall website performance, including your Core Web Vitals metrics. If you‚Äôre looking to improve user experience and speed up your WordPress site, images are a good place to start.</p>\n<p>Even Google tells you to take care of your images! If you have ever run a performance audit on PageSpeed Insights, you might have seen the <a href=\"https://imagify.io/blog/serve-next-gen-formats-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">‚Äúserve images in next-gen formats‚Äù</a> opportunity popping up. Another PageSpeed Insights recommendation related to images is to <a href=\"https://imagify.io/blog/efficiently-encode-images-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">‚Äúefficiently encode images‚Äù</a>. When you use Imagify, you will be able to address both recommendations and fix your images for a faster website.</p>\n<h4>What Do Our Users Think Of Imagify?</h4>\n<p>Here‚Äôs what our users have to say about us after optimizing their images with Imagify:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Images and other media are the largest parts on your web pages (most likely).

      "description": "<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Optimize your website&#039;s performance with the new Image Optimizer by Elementor plugin\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fco5omeF50w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Image Optimizer is an easy-to-use WordPress plugin that reduces image size through various compression and resizing techniques &#8211; all of which preserve the highest possible image quality. Image Optimizer supports many popular formats, including  JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, and GIF.</p>\n<h4>REDUCED FILE SIZES FOR BOOSTED PERFORMANCE</h4>\n<p>Image Optimizer ensures faster loading times, enhanced user experience, and overall boosted website performance by reducing the size of your website&#8217;s images, resulting in improved Core Web Vitals and search engine rankings. With the Image Optimizer‚Äôs exceptional capabilities and unique algorithms, you can fine tune images and reduce their file sizes while retaining quality with lossless or lossy compression.</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Image formats supported</strong> include JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF and GIF.</li>\n<li><strong>Works in the background</strong>: The only plugin in the category that optimizes your images in the background, without you having to stay on the page during optimization.</li>\n<li><strong>Resize large images</strong>: The user can set a maximum pixel width, after which images will automatically be resized. (default value set to 1920px)</li>\n<li><strong>2 compression levels</strong>:  Lossless &#8211; highest quality with minimal compression; Lossy &#8211; maximum compression with somewhat reduced quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimize on upload</strong>: Automatically optimizes images when you upload them.</li>\n<li><strong>Bulk or individual optimization</strong>: Flexible image optimization options, whether it&#8217;s on-demand scaling and compression, or bulk optimization for your entire image library.</li>\n<li><strong>EXIF Metadata</strong>: Select whether to clear image metadata to reduce size even further without impacting image quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Backup original images</strong>: Ability to delete backups permanently to save space. (We recommend backing up your website beforehand.)</li>\n<li><strong>Restore original images</strong> (all sizes) for selected media files if needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Convert to WebP and AVIF</strong>: Get efficient and faster-loading formats with WebP  and AVIF for even better web performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Image thumbnails</strong>: Resize all image sizes by default. Allow the user to choose specific image sizes based on WordPress-registered thumbnail sizes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>BULK OR SINGLE IMAGE OPTIMIZATION</h4>\n<p>Image Optimizer by Elementor lets you optimize all images in your library either one at a time, or in a batch according to your preferences and settings. Easily configure the plugin to scale or compress your images on-demand, or automatically have them triggered as they are being uploaded. Or, if you have a large number of images already uploaded, the bulk optimization feature allows you to resize and/or compress your entire library of existing images in just a few clicks.</p>\n<h4>2 COMPRESSION LEVELS</h4>\n<p>With Image Optimizer‚Äôs advanced algorithms, you can compress images and reduce their file size at the level that makes the most sense for you. We offer 2 types of compression where images will be processed, giving you the perfect balance of compression and quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Lossless Compression</strong>: Lossless compression reduces image file sizes without sacrificing or diminishing the quality of your images. This type of compression reduces file sizes by removing unused or unnecessary data so that no image details are lost along the way.  Hence, you are able to reduce the file size and still maintain the quality of your image.</p>\n<p><strong>Lossy Compression</strong>: Lossy compression performs maximum compression resulting in lightweight images and smaller file sizes. It reduces image size by removing image data that is generally invisible to the human eye and minimizes any compromise in image quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Convert to WebP and AVIF</strong>: Convert images to the slimmer WebP or AVIF formats for even better optimization with a 25-30% savings over JPEG and PNG. Most browsers support WebP, however if they don‚Äôt, you can have fallback versions of the image available in the same format as the original image.</p>\n<p>By tailoring compression to the level you need, your visitors will enjoy faster load times, improved responsiveness, and a seamless browsing experience. Our approach also enables your website to rank higher in search results. Since a search engine&#8217;s ranking is heavily influenced by speed, user experience, and Core Web Vitals, Image Optimizer by Elementor is an invaluable tool for any website, especially one that‚Äôs abundant with images.</p>\n<h4>Get Started Today</h4>\n<p>For more information about Image Optimizer, visit our <a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-product-page/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official website</a> or <a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-free-trial/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Try It Now</a>.<br />\nIf you have any questions or need support, feel free to <a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact us</a> or visit our <a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-help-center/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help center</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin requires a connection to an active Elementor account in order to identify the user and provide the user with the purchased service. This connection is triggered manually by the user via the plugin&#8217;s settings panel.<br />\nThis plugin uses a 3rd party service operated by Elementor, which accepts a standard image in JPG, PNG, GIF or WEBP format and returns a web optimized image based on the selected settings. This flow is triggered by the user or automatically (based on the selected plugin settings) on compatible image upload or by manually initiating optimize process.</p>\n<h3>Related Plugins</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/site-mailer/\" rel=\"ugc\">Site Mailer</a>: Effortlessly manage transactional emails with Site Mailer.

Did I mention, no coding is required üôÇ</p>\n<h4>Creating WordPress Landing Pages with SeedProd</h4>\n<p>What are landing pages? A landing page is a standalone web page that a person &#8220;lands&#8221; on after clicking through from an email, ad, or other digital location. Most of the time, these landing pages have a different design from the rest of your site and do not show your website&#8217;s standard header and footer.</p>\n<p>Landing Pages have a particular purpose and desired user action; therefore, you want them to be distraction-free as possible. With SeedProd, it is super easy to create high-converting landing pages for any purpose, that are entirely separate from your website&#8217;s design.</p>\n<p>You can use our Domain Mapping feature to put landings page on their own domain, our Dynamic Text feature to add personalization, or our WooCommerce Blocks to build one-off product pages. These are just a few of the many powerful features SeedProd provides.</p>\n<h4>Building Coming Soon Pages and Maintenance Mode Pages with SeedProd</h4>\n<p>SeedProd allows you to build a coming soon or maintenance mode page that will hide your site from visitors and search engines like Google. You can work on your website in private. When the website uses coming soon mode, the page will be indexed by Google as long as your site is not set to be private in WordPress.</p>\n<p>In Maintenance Mode, we return a 503 header status that lets Google know your site is down for maintenance.</p>\n<p>Both of these modes are essential for any WordPress Website to have.</p>\n<p>The Free Version of SeedProd comes with a variety of Coming Soon Page and Maintenance Mode templates.</p>\n<h3>Full Page Builder Feature List:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress Theme Builder &#8211; Create Headers, Footers, Pages, Posts, Archives, Sidebars, WooCommerce Pages or any part of a WordPress theme with our no-code Theme Builder.</li>\n<li>Fast Drag &amp; Drop Page Builder &#8211; Our page builder is super fast, lightweight and responsive.</li>\n<li>WordPress Themes created with SeedProd work with any page builder.</li>\n<li>Landing Pages work with any WordPress Theme.</li>\n<li>200+ Professionally Designed WordPress Themes, Landing Page Templates &amp; Layout Sections</li>\n<li>80+ Pro Page Blocks &#8211; We have created a variety of blocks to display static and dynamic content.</li>\n<li>Landing Page Templates &#8211; Sale Pages, Coming Soon Pages, Maintenance Mode Pages, Webinar Pages, Giveaway Pages, Thank You Pages, 404 Pages, and Login Pages</li>\n<li>Responsive and Mobile Ready &#8211; Pages created with SeedProd look great on any device.</li>\n<li>Premium Integrations &#8211; Collect emails with your favorite 3rd party email marketing service providers, including MailChimp, ActiveCampaign, ConvertKit, Constant Contact, and more&#8230;</li>\n<li>Subscriber Management &#8211; Track every subscriber with or without a 3rd party email provider.</li>\n<li>Stock Images &#8211; Get In-Plugin Access to over 2 Million Stock Images.

      "description": "<p>Google Tag Manager (GTM) is Google&#8217;s free tool for everyone to manage and deploy analytics and marketing tags as well as other code snippets<br />\nusing an intuitive web UI. To learn more about this tool, visit the <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official website</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin places the GTM container code snippets onto your WordPress website so that you do not need to add it manually.<br />\nMultiple containers are also supported!</p>\n<p>The plugin complements your GTM setup by pushing page meta data and user information into the so called data layer.<br />\nGoogle&#8217;s official help pages includes <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer#datalayer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">more details about the data layer</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>PHP 7.4 is required to use this plugin.</strong></p>\n<h4>GTM container code placement</h4>\n<p>The original GTM container code is divided into two parts:</p>\n<p>The first part is a javascript code snippet that is added to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of every page of the website.<br />\nThis part is critical to enable all features of GTM, and this plugin helps to place this part<br />\ncorrectly on your site.</p>\n<p>The second part is an iframe snippet that acts as a failsafe/fallback should users&#8217; JavaScript be disabled.<br />\nGoogle recommends ‚Äì for best performance ‚Äì to place this code snippet directly after the opening <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag on each page.</p>\n<p>Albeit not ideal, it will work when placed lower in the code. This plugin provides a code placement option for the second code snippet.</p>\n<p>If your WordPress theme is compatible with the additions of WordPress 5.2 then this plugin will place this second code to the right place.<br />\nUsers of the Genisis theme, GeneratePress theme, Elementor, Oxygen Builder and Beaver Builder Theme will also have this placed correctly.<br />\nTo utilize this, set the compatibility mode in plugin options to off.</p>\n<p>All other users can place this second code snippet using a custom PHP code (&#8220;Manually coded&#8221; option) or select the so called &#8220;Footer&#8221; option to<br />\nadd the code lower in the code (it is not the recommended way but will work)</p>\n<h4>Basic data included</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>post/page titles</li>\n<li>post/page dates</li>\n<li>post/page category names</li>\n<li>post/page tag names</li>\n<li>post/page author ID and name</li>\n<li>post/page ID</li>\n<li>post types</li>\n<li>post format</li>\n<li>post count on the current page + in the current category/tag/taxonomy</li>\n<li>custom terms associated with any post type</li>\n<li>logged in status</li>\n<li>logged in user role</li>\n<li>logged in user ID (to track cross device behaviour in Google Analytics)</li>\n<li>logged in user email address (both unhashed and SHA256 hased values to be used with tracking)</li>\n<li>logger in user creation date</li>\n<li>site search data</li>\n<li>site name and id (for WordPress multisite instances)</li>\n<li>IP address of the visitor (please use the explicit consent of the visitor to utilize this)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Browser / OS / Device data</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>browser data (name, version, engine)</li>\n<li>OS data (name, version)</li>\n<li>device data (type, manufacturer, model)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data is provided using the WhichBrowser library: http://whichbrowser.net/</p>\n<h4>Weather data</h4>\n<p>(beta)</p>\n<p>Push data about users&#8217; current weather conditions into the dataLayer. This can be used to generate weather-related<br />\naudience/remarketing lists on ad platforms and allows for user segmentation in your web analytics solutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>weather category (clouds, rain, snow, etc.)</li>\n<li>weather description: more detailed data</li>\n<li>temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit</li>\n<li>air pressure</li>\n<li>wind speed and degrees</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Weather data is queried from Open Weather Map. Depending on your websites traffic, additional fees may apply:<br />\nhttp://openweathermap.org/price</p>\n<p>An (free) API key from OpenWeatherMap is required for this feature to work.</p>\n<p>ipstack.com is used to determine the site visitor&#8217;s location. A (free) API key from IPStack.com is required for this feature to work:<br />\nhttps://ipstack.com/product</p>\n<h4>Media player events</h4>\n<p>(experimental)</p>\n<p>Track users&#8217; interaction with any embedded media:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>YouTube</li>\n<li>Vimeo</li>\n<li>Soundcloud</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DataLayer events can be chosen to fire upon media player load, media is being played, paused/stopped and optionally when<br />\nthe user reaches 10, 20, 30, &#8230;, 90, 100% of the media duration.</p>\n<p>Tracking is supported for embedded media using the built-in oEmbed feature of WordPress as well as most other media plugins<br />\nand copy/pasted codes. Players injected into the website after page load are not currently supported.</p>\n<h4>Scroll tracking</h4>\n<p>Fire tags based on how the visitor scrolls from the top to the bottom of a page.<br />\nAn example would be to separate &#8220;readers&#8221; (who spend a specified amount of time on a page) from &#8220;scrollers&#8221;<br />\n(who only scroll through within seconds). You can use these events to fire Analytics tags and/or remarketing/conversion tags<br />\n(for micro conversions).</p>\n<p>Scroll tracking is based on the solution originally created by</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nick Mihailovski</li>\n<li>Thomas Baekdal</li>\n<li>Avinash Kaushik</li>\n<li>Joost de Valk</li>\n<li>Eivind Savio</li>\n<li>Justin Cutroni</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Original script:<br />\nhttp://cutroni.com/blog/2012/02/21/advanced-content-tracking-with-google-analytics-part-1/</p>\n<h4>Blacklist &amp; Whitelist Tag Manager tags, triggers and variables</h4>\n<p>To increase website security, you have the option to white- and blacklist tags/triggers/variables.<br />\nYou can prevent specific tags from firing or the use of certain variable types regardless of your GTM setup.</p>\n<p>If the Google account associated with your GTM account is being hacked, an attacker could easily<br />\nexecute malware on your website without accessing its code on your hosting server. By blacklisting custom HTML tags<br />\nand/or custom JavaScript variables you can secure the Tag Manager container.</p>\n<h4>Integration</h4>\n<p>Google Tag Manager for WordPress integrates with several popular plugins. More integration to come!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact Form 7: fire an event when a Contact Form 7 form was submitted with any result (mail sent, mail failed, spam detected, invalid input)</li>\n<li>WooCommerce:\n<ul>\n<li>Implementation of <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/ecommerce-ga4\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GA4 E-commerce</a></li>\n<li>Does not support promotions since WooCommerce does not have such a feature (yet)</li>\n<li>Does not support refunds</li>\n<li>Compatibility with High Performance Order Storage (HPOS)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>AMP: load your AMP container on the AMP version of your pages</li>\n<li>Cookiebot: use automatic cookie blocking mode if needed</li>\n<li>Google Consent Mode v2: fire the &#8220;default&#8221; command with specific consent flags to integrat with non-certified Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) and plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Server side containers</h4>\n<p>If you are using a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/serverside/send-data#update_the_gtmjs_source_domain\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">server side container</a><br />\nyou can enter your custom domain name and custom path to load gtm.js from your there.</p>\n<h4>Exclude specific user roles from being tracked</h4>\n<p>You can set which user roles needs to be excluded from tracking when a user with that role visits the frontend. This will completely disable the container code for that user.</p>\n",

So you can continue using plugins and theme functions that extend the Classic Editor. Supports awesome features like Meta Boxes, Quicktags, Custom Fields, and everything else the Classic Editor can do.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does not &#8220;expire&#8221; in 2022! üôÇ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Easy to Use</strong></p>\n<p>Just activate and done!

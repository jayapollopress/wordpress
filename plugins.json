For instance, if your website is <code>example.com</code>, then the blog-wide profile can be found at <code>@example.com@example.com</code>, and authors like Jane and Bob would have their individual profiles at <code>@jane@example.com</code> and <code>@bobz@example.com</code>, respectively.</p>\n<p>An example: I give you my Mastodon profile name: <code>@pfefferle@mastodon.social</code>. You search, see my profile, and hit follow. Now, any post I make appears in your Home feed. Similarly, with the ActivityPub plugin, you can find and follow Jane&#8217;s profile at <code>@jane@example.com</code>.</p>\n<p>Once you follow Jane&#8217;s <code>@jane@example.com</code> profile, any blog post she crafts on <code>example.com</code> will land in your Home feed. Simultaneously, by following the blog-wide profile <code>@example.com@example.com</code>, you&#8217;ll receive updates from all authors.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: If no one follows your author or blog instance, your posts remain unseen. The simplest method to verify the plugin&#8217;s operation is by following your profile. If you possess a Mastodon profile, initiate by following your new one.</p>\n<p>The plugin works with the following tested federated platforms, but there may be more that it works with as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mastodon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pleroma.social/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pleroma</a>/<a href=\"https://akkoma.social/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Akkoma</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://friendi.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">friendica</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hubzilla.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Hubzilla</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pixelfed.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pixelfed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://socialhome.network/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Socialhome</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://join.misskey.page/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Misskey</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://joinfirefish.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Firefish</a> (rebrand of Calckey)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some things to note:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The blog-wide profile is only compatible with sites with rewrite rules enabled. If your site does not have rewrite rules enabled, the author-specific profiles may still work.</li>\n<li>Many single-author blogs have chosen to turn off or redirect their author profile pages, usually via an SEO plugin like Yoast or Rank Math. This is usually done to avoid duplicate content with your blog’s home page. If your author page has been deactivated in this way, then ActivityPub author profiles won’t work for you. Instead, you can turn your author profile page back on, and then use the option in your SEO plugin to noindex the author page. This will still resolve duplicate content issues with search engines and will enable ActivityPub author profiles to work.</li>\n<li>Once ActivityPub is installed, <em>only new posts going forward</em> will be available in the fediverse. Likewise, even if you’ve been using ActivityPub for a while, anyone who follows your site will only see new posts you publish from that moment on. They will never see previously-published posts in their Home feed. This process is very similar to subscribing to a newsletter. If you subscribe to a newsletter, you will only receive future emails, but not the old archived ones. With ActivityPub, if someone follows your site, they will only receive new blog posts you publish from then on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So what’s the process?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the ActivityPub plugin.</li>\n<li>Go to the plugin’s settings page and adjust the settings to your liking. Click the Save button when ready.</li>\n<li>Make sure your blog’s author profile page is active if you are using author profiles.</li>\n<li>Go to Mastodon or any other federated platform, and search for your profile, and follow it. Your new profile will be in the form of either <code>@your_username@example.com</code> or <code>@example.com@example.com</code>, so that is what you’ll search for.</li>\n<li>On your blog, publish a new post.</li>\n<li>From Mastodon, check to see if the new post appears in your Home feed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: It may take up to 15 minutes or so for the new post to show up in your federated feed. This is because the messages are sent to the federated platforms using a delayed cron. This avoids breaking the publishing process for those cases where users might have lots of followers. So please don’t assume that just because you didn’t see it show up right away that something is broken. Give it some time. In most cases, it will show up within a few minutes, and you’ll know everything is working as expected.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Admin Debug Tools makes it easy to manage your site&#8217;s logs and debug settings directly from the dashboard, without needing to edit backend files.</p>\n<h3>Debug Log</h3>\n<p>The Debug Log file is one of the most powerful tools for WordPress site admins and developers to troubleshoot issues on their site. But, accessing the debug log file can be a hassle, requiring backend file edits and SSH or FTP access.</p>\n<p>Admin Debug Tools simplifies the process by giving you the power to manage your debug log from the WP Admin area.</p>\n<p>With Admin Debug Tools, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>View a formatted version of the debug log file;</li>\n<li>Monitor the latest log entries in near real-time <em>(improvements to come)</em>;</li>\n<li>Filter log entries by type (<code>Error</code>, <code>Warning</code>, <code>Notices</code>, <code>Deprecations</code>);</li>\n<li>Search log entries by keyword with regex operators;</li>\n<li>Save and/or clear your debug log file;</li>\n<li>Download your debug log file;</li>\n<li>Toggle debug mode on and off with a single click;</li>\n<li>Edit the WP_DEBUG, WP_DEBUG_LOG, and other debug related constants;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WP Debugging</h3>\n<p>Admin Debug Tools makes direct edits to your <code>wp-config.php</code> file to enable and disable debug mode through the <code>WP_DEBUG</code> constant.</p>\n<p>You have full control over the WP debug constants through the Config screen.</p>\n<p>When you enable debug mode, WordPress will log errors, notices, and warnings to the debug log file. This can be helpful for troubleshooting issues on your site.</p>\n<p>When you disable debug mode, WordPress will stop logging errors, notices, and warnings to the debug log file. This can be helpful for reducing server load and improving site performance.</p>\n<p>https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/debug-wordpress/</p>\n<h3>Future Features</h3>\n<p>Here are some of the features I have on my radar and plan to implement in future versions of Admin Debug Tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debug log file rotation;</li>\n<li>Option to ignore certain errors and reduce the noise in the log file;</li>\n<li>Custom and usefull error pages for debugging;</li>\n<li>Screen to debug database queries;</li>\n<li>Debug helper functions to use in your code and print debug information to the log file;</li>\n<li>Troubleshoot session mode to disable plugins and themes, and separate debugging from the main site;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>Admin Debug Tools is open source and we welcome contributions! You can find the source code and development instructions in our GitHub repository:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/tjdsneto/admin-debug-tools</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in contributing, please check the repository for development setup instructions, coding standards, and contribution guidelines.</p>\n",

That&#8217;s all.</p>\n<p>Most other image optimization plugins (such as Smush or LiteSpeed) use batch conversion.<br />\nThese plugins convert ALL images in the upload folder, including thumbnails.<br />\nThis is not necessary, as some of these images might never be requested.<br />\natec-WebP works &#8220;on demand&#8221;, it converts images only when requested. This saves disk space.</p>\n<p>In case you are using a CDN the rewrite rules to serve .webp files will not be effective – unless you exclude image files from caching.<br />\nPlease check the response header to see whether .webp files are actually handled by your server – or delivered by a CDN.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supports IMG_WEBP_LOSSLESS quality.</li>\n<li>Supports BMP, GIF, PNG &amp; JPEG image format.</li>\n<li>Supports transparent GIF &amp; PNG files (plus BMP with ImageMagick).</li>\n<li>Unsupported files (like animated GIFs and transparent BMP with GD-extension) will be skipped automatically.</li>\n<li>Lightweight (64KB) and resource-efficient.</li>\n<li>Backend CPU footprint: &lt;1 ms. (plus only a few ms if a file needs conversion).</li>\n<li>Frontend CPU footprint: &lt;1 ms.<br />\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p>atec-WebP requires write permission for the /.htaccess file and a webserver that supports rewrite rules (mod_rewrite).<br />\nRewrite rules will be added to the .htaccess file only if you check the &#8220;WebP active&#8221; option.<br />\nThe rules will be deleted if you uncheck the option or deactivate the plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Image requests will be redirected to their WebP counterpart, if the WebP version exists, otherwise the request will be redirected to a script in the ./uploads/atec-webp folder. The script converts image files to *.Xwebp.webp files in their respective folder. There will be no extra folders for the converted images, so everythings stays in place. However you can still delete the convert files at any time, as they are easily identified by their .Xwebp.webp extension.</p>\n<p>atec-WebP dashboard also provides a feature to delete these files, with no impact on the original files.</p>\n<h3>Attention</h3>\n<p>DO NOT disallow script execution in wp-content/uplods folder by a &#8220;deny from all&#8221; rule, because the conversion script resides in the wp-content/uplods/atec-webp.</p>\n<h3>3rd party scripts</h3>\n<p>The plugin uses &#8220;basicLightbox&#8221; to preview images.<br />\nSource code @ https://github.com/electerious/basicLightbox</p>\n<h3>3rd party as a service</h3>\n<p>Once, when activating the plugin, an integrity check is requested from our server (https://atecplugins.com/) – if you give your permission.<br />\nPrivacy policy: https://atecplugins.com/privacy-policy/</p>\n<h3>atec-WebP and Cloudflare compatibility</h3>\n<p>The plugin does not replace image files in the media library nor does it alter the image attachments in pages or posts.<br />\nIt works by serving .webp images instead of other images formats by converting those images in the uploads folder and rewriting requests to the original image by the use of .htaccess rewrite rules.<br />\nFor the plugin to be in effect, the browser must send an „accept“ header that includes the „image/webp“ mime type.<br />\nHowever, if you use cloudflare, the cloudflare crawler will not send this header, thus the redirect script will not run the rewrite rule.<br />\nAs a result, the crawler will get the original image and atec-WebP is not interfere.</p>\n<h3>atec-WebP and LiteSpeed web-server compatibility</h3>\n<p>LiteSpeed support for .htaccess files depends on the web-server configuration. LiteSpeed must reload the .htaccess after it has been altered by atec-WebP. It can take several minutes for the changes to have effect.</p>\n",

    "description": "<h4>Reduce your WordPress website’s risk to nearly zero with Solid Security</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.solidwp.com/wporg-security-ithemes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Formerly iThemes Security. Looking for iThemes? Learn more here.</a></p>\n<p>On average, 30,000 websites are hacked every day.* Cyberattacks in the US increased by 57% in 2022.** Bad actors who want to hack your site, steal your data, and cripple your business are a 24/7/365 threat.</p>\n<p>You need a proactive, strategic approach to WordPress website security that protects your site from brute force attacks, malware infections, and other cyber threats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.solidwp.com/solid-security-pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Solid Security</a> shields your site from cyberattacks and prevents security vulnerabilities.

It secures and protects your most commonly attacked part of your WordPress website – user login authentication.</p>\n<p>With Patchstack integration (Pro) protects your site before you even have a chance to address vulnerabilities and before a plugin or theme vendor or developer can even issue a patch.</p>\n<p>That’s 24/7/365 always-on truly Solid Security.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Welcome to Solid Security, Part of the SolidWP Suite\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/863249227?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"></iframe></p>\n<h4>🌐 Secure your Website in Minutes</h4>\n<p>The Solid Security setup and onboarding experience allows anyone to secure their WordPress website in under 10 minutes, regardless of technical acumen. Knowing that you have enabled all the right security settings for your website will leave you feeling like your site has never been more secure.</p>\n<h4>📚 Security Site Templates to Fit Your Type of Site</h4>\n<p>Enabling the correct security settings based on the type of website you are building or maintaining is essential for proper security. An eCommerce site requires a different level of security than a basic blog. Solid Security Site Templates make it quick and easy to apply the right security settings for your website.</p>\n<p>Choose from six different site templates to apply the type of security your site needs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ecommerce</strong> – websites that sell products or services</li>\n<li><strong>Network</strong> – websites that connect people or communities</li>\n<li><strong>Non-Profit</strong> – websites that promote your cause and collect donations</li>\n<li><strong>Blog</strong> – websites that share your thoughts or start a conversation</li>\n<li><strong>Portfolio</strong> – websites that showcase your craft</li>\n<li><strong>Brochure</strong> – simple websites that promote your business</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>⌚ Real-Time Website Security Dashboard</h4>\n<p>Every day, lots of activity is happening on your website that you can&#8217;t see. Many of these activities can be related to your site&#8217;s security, so monitoring these events is vital to keeping your site secure.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://go.solidwp.com/solid-security-pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Solid Security Pro</a> plugin provides a real-time WordPress security dashboard that monitors security-related events on your site around the clock. The Solid Security Dashboard is a dynamic dashboard with all your WordPress website’s security activity stats in one place, including brute force attacks, banned users, active lockouts, site scan results, and user security stats (Pro).</p>\n<h4>🗝️ WordPress Login Security</h4>\n<p>Setting up and maintaining proper WordPress configurations and managing user account access are essential aspects of hardening your site against threats and vulnerabilities. Basic and Pro include features that address both of these factors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Two Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong> &#8211; Make your WordPress login nearly impenetrable to attack by requiring users to enter a security code along with a password to login. The Solid Security plugin allows you to add two-factor authentication to your WordPress login with several authentication methods, including mobile apps like Authy and Google Authenticator, email, and backup codes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Password Requirements</strong> &#8211; Create and enforce a password policy for your users in less than a minute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>reCAPTCHA</strong> (Pro) &#8211; Stop bad bots from engaging in abusive activities on your website, such as attempting to break into your website using compromised passwords, posting spam, or even scraping your content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Passwordless Logins</strong> (Pro) &#8211; WordPress security made easy. Secure your user accounts with 2fa &amp; strong passwords while allowing real users login with a click of a mouse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trusted Devices</strong> (Pro) &#8211; Identify the devices you and other users use to block session hijacking attacks and limit Administrator privileges to Trusted Devices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automated Vulnerability Patching</strong> (Pro) &#8211; Solid Security Pro includes Patchstack which patches vulnerabilities before you have a chance to and applies fixes even before a plugin developer or vendor has issued a patch.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learn more about how <a href=\"https://go.solidwp.com/wporgpasswordless\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">passwordless login is the future</a> and how Solid Security can help you implement it today.</p>\n<h4>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 The Right Amount of Security for Every User Level</h4>\n<p>Different types of user levels require different levels of security. During the Solid Security setup process, you can identify your website’s key user groups. Once the different types of users are identified, you can apply the level of security that is just right for each user group.</p>\n<p>Here are a couple of examples of how User Groups are useful for securing your site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>For Clients</strong> – Let’s say you are configuring Solid Security on a client’s website. You will decide whether or not they are required to use two-factor authentication and if they should have access to the Solid Security settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>For Customers</strong> – If you have an eCommerce website, you will decide whether or not you want to protect customer accounts with a password policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Privilege Escalation</strong> (Pro) also adds a safe, secure way to grant temporary admin-level access to your website.</p>\n<h4>🤖 Block Bad Bots &amp; Ban User Agents with Lockouts</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ban Users</strong> (Basic and Pro) &#8211; Permanently block repeat offenders from accessing your site.<br />\nLocal Brute Force Protection &#8211; Automatically identify and stop the most common method of attack on WordPress sites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Local Brute Force Protection</strong> (Basic and Pro) – Automatically identify and stop the most common method of attack on WordPress sites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Network Brute Force Protection</strong> (Basic and Pro) &#8211; The network is the Solid Security community and is nearly one million websites strong. If someone tries to break into websites in the Solid Security community, Solid Security will block them across the network.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Magic Links</strong> (Pro) &#8211; Security shouldn’t get in your way. Magic Links allow you to log in to your WordPress site while your username is locked out by the Solid Security Local Brute Force Protection feature.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>🔍 Monitor Your Site&#8217;s Security Health</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>File Change Detection</strong> (Basic and Pro) &#8211; Solid Security logs changes made to your website that can help detect malicious activity on your website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Site Scanner</strong> (Basic and Pro) &#8211; Enable twice-daily checks for known vulnerabilities of WordPress core file, plugins and themes. Using the Google Safe Browsing API, the Site Scan also checks your Google’s blocklist status and will alert you if Google has found any malware on your website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Site Scanner</strong> (Pro) &#8211; Unlock Version Management to automatically apply a patch to vulnerable software detected by the Site Scan when one is available.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User Logging</strong> (Pro) &#8211; Keep a record of user activity in your WordPress security logs, including login/logout, user registration, adding/removing plugins, switching themes, changes to posts and pages, and more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Version Management</strong> (Pro) &#8211; The Version Management feature in Solid Security Pro allows you to auto-update WordPress, plugins, and themes. Beyond that, Version Management also has options to harden your website when you are running outdated software and scan for old websites.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>🛠️ Website Security Utilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enforce SSL</strong> &#8211; Force all connections to the website to be made over SSL/TLS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Database Backups</strong> &#8211; Create backups of your WordPress database.

    "description": "<p>This plugin provides the ability to embed Bible reading plans into a post or page using shortcode of the form <code>[bible-reading-plan source=\"DBP\" reading_plan=\"mcheyne\" bible_id=\"ENGNAS\" bible_all_audio_id=\"\" bible_ot_audio_id=\"\" bible_nt_audio_id=\"\"]</code>. <strong>The last three parameters are new in this version and provide access to audio versions of the Scriptures, this shortcode applies only to the DBP source and <em>provides access to over 2000 Bible versions in nearly 1900 languages,</em> with more versions and languages being added regularly.</strong> Three sources for the Scriptures displayed for each plan are available: American Bible Society API, Version 1 (API.Bible), The Bible Brain (aka Digital Bible Platform) API, Version 4 (faithcomesbyhearing.com/bible-brain/developer-documentation), and the ESV Bible Web Service API, Version 3 (api.esv.org). See the screenshots for an example of how to use this plugin.</p>\n<p>The American Bible Society API provides more than 20 English language versions (with the potential for more via the Digital Bible Library to acquire the necessary licenses) and the potential of over 1600 languages in a future version of this plugin The Bible Brain API provides 10 English versions and access to over 2000 Bible versions in nearly 1900 languages. In addition, it has audio versions and the potential for video for many of the versions. The ESV Bible Web Service API, Version 3 also provides audio as well as better formatting control. Naturally it provides only the English Standard Version.</p>\n<p>It is hoped that persons with skills in other languages will come forward to localize this plugin for the available languages. (I.e., Translate things like the instructions on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; page, the reading plan names, and copyright statements.)</p>\n<p>The values of reading_plan can be:</p>\n<pre><code>back-to-the-bible-chronological - Back to the Bible Chronological\nbcp19-acna-evening - Book of Common Prayer, 2019, Anglican Church in North America -- Evening Prayer\nbcp19-acna-morning - Book of Common Prayer, 2019, Anglican Church in North America -- Morning Prayer\nbcp19-acna-twoyear - Book of Common Prayer, 2019, Anglican Church in North America -- Two Year Plan \nchronicles-and-prophets - Chronicles and Prophets\ndaily-light-on-the-daily-path-evening - Daily Light on the Daily Path -- Evening\ndaily-light-on-the-daily-path-morning - Daily Light on the Daily Path -- Morning\nevery-day-in-the-word - Every Day In the Word\ngospels-and-epistles - Gospel and Epistles\nheart-light-ot-and-nt - Heartlight Old and New Testament\nlsb - Literary Study Bible\nmcheyne - M'Cheyne One-Year Reading Plan\none-year-chronological - One Year Chronological\npentateuch-and-history-of-israel - Pentateuch and History of Israel\npsalms-and-wisdom-literature - Psalms and Wisdom Literature\nthrough-the-bible - Through the Bible in a Year\n</code></pre>\n<p>The default reading plan is M&#8217;Cheyne One-Year Reading Plan.</p>\n<p>We may add more plans in the future, but have created a premium plugin &#8220;Create Bible Reading Plans&#8221; (https://sllwi.re/p/1Il) to make it possible to create one&#8217;s own Bible reading plan for use in this plugin.</p>\n<p>The values of source can be:</p>\n<pre><code>ABS - American Bible Society (API.Bible)\nDBP - Bible Brain (aka Digital Bible Platform) (faithcomesbyhearing.com/bible-brain/developer-documentation)\nESV - ESV Bible Web Service API (api.esv.org)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The default source is DBP.</p>\n<p>(Note that, in order to use these sources, you must obtain Access Keys from the American Bible Society, the Bible Brain, and/or the ESV Bible Web Service API.

ugc\"><strong>webhook</strong></a> as well.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>♻ How does this plugin work?</h3>\n<p>This plugin acts as a bridge between platforms, using Triggers and Actions. Triggers capture data, like form submissions (Contact Form 7, WP Forms, etc.), while Actions send it to CRM, Email Marketing Software, Project Management Tools, Data Collection Tools, and other WordPress plugins.<br />\nFor example, a contact form (Bit Form, WP Forms, etc.)<br />\nis submitted, and you want to send data in your CRM, Email Marketing Software, Project Management Tools, Data Collection Tools, and Other WordPress plugins.</p>\n<h3>Telemetry Data</h3>\n<p>Bit Integrations uses <a href=\"https://packagist.org/packages/bitapps/wp-telemetry\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wp-telemetry</a> to collect some telemetry data upon user’s confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster &amp; make product improvements.</p>\n<p>Wp-Telemetry <strong>DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY</strong> start gathering data, rather it will gather basic telemetry data when a user allows it. We collect the data to ensure great user experience for all our users</p>\n<h3>❣ What our customer say about Bit Integrations :</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/best-of-class-with-few-glitches/\" rel=\"ugc\"><code>💠 Best of class</code></a><br />\n-by @saschinger</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/bit-integrations-is-an-affordable-alternative-to-pabbly-and-zapier/\" rel=\"ugc\"><code>💠 Bit Integrations is an affordable alternative to Pabbly Connect and Zapier</code></a><br />\n-by @barrynthdegreegroupnet</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-game-changer-for-my-wordpress-automation/\" rel=\"ugc\"><code>💠 A Game Changer for My WordPress automation</code></a><br />\n-by @angelitos</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/zapier-like-integrations-without-the-fees/\" rel=\"ugc\"><code>💠 Zapier-like Integrations, No Fees Required!</code></a><br />\n-by @peterode</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/zapier-for-wordpress/\" rel=\"ugc\"><code>💠 Zapier for WordPress Made Easy!</code></a><br />\n-by @onedogsolutions</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pure-automation-at-play/\" rel=\"ugc\"><code>💠 Pure Automation at Play!</code></a><br />\n-by @vaishakdamu</p>\n<h3>💥 In the free version, you can create unlimited integrations using free triggers, while the pro version offers unlimited integration capabilities using all triggers.</h3>\n<h3>⚡ Key Features:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Easy integration setup with a few clicks.

    "description": "<h4>Sprinkle Festive Joy on Your Website</h4>\n<p>Boom Fest plugin is an excellent tool for website owners who want to add a touch of celebration to their website pages. The plugin is straightforward to use and provides users with several options to customize their pages to match different types of celebrations.</p>\n<p>To use the Boom Fest plugin, all you need to do is install and activate it on your website. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you can begin customizing your pages with a range of festive options. There are five festival options available in this plugin, each with unique animations, font styles, and decorated images.</p>\n<h4>Festival Options:</h4>\n<p>✅ New Year<br />\n✅ Christmas<br />\n✅ Halloween<br />\n✅ Spring<br />\n✅ Black Friday</p>\n<p>Each festival option in Boom Fest comes with its own unique animation, font style, and decorated images. These customizations allow you to add a festive flair to your pages and create a celebratory atmosphere for your visitors. Whether you&#8217;re celebrating the New Year, Christmas, Halloween, Spring, or Black Friday the Boom Fest plugin has got you covered.</p>\n<h4>Celebration Animations:</h4>\n<p>The Boom Fest plugin offers various celebration animations to choose from, such as ribbons, balloons, and confetti. One of the most popular animation options is the ribbon animation, which adds a colorful and dynamic touch to your pages. The ribbon animation flows along the top or bottom of the page, creating a celebratory atmosphere that is perfect for any occasion.</p>\n<h4>Decorated Images:</h4>\n<p>Boom Fest also offers a range of decorated images that you can use to add more festivity to your pages. These images come in various sizes, and they are specifically designed to complement the celebration animations. For example, the ribbon decoration image is ideal for use with the ribbon animation. To use decorated images, ensure that the image width is between 220px to 400px so that it doesn&#8217;t apply to images like banners.</p>\n<h4>Font Styles:</h4>\n<p>The plugin also includes several font styles that can be applied to the H1 tag to give your pages a unique and festive look. For instance, the New Year 1 font style is perfect for the New Year celebration. By using these font styles, you can easily create a celebratory atmosphere on your pages that your visitors will love.</p>\n<h4>Select Pages to Reflect:</h4>\n<p>Boom Fest plugin allows users to choose which pages they want to apply the festive effects and animations. This feature is particularly useful if you only want to add a festive vibe to certain pages on your website, such as the homepage or landing pages. With the Boom Fest plugin, you can easily select which pages you want to reflect, and the plugin will apply the selected festive effects to those pages.</p>\n<h4>Extension Add-ons:</h4>\n<p>For users who want more customization options, the Boom Fest plugin also has extension add-ons available. However, these add-ons are currently on hold, and they will be premium. Once these add-ons become available, they will provide users with more customizations, such as additional festive animations, font styles, and decorated images.</p>\n<h3>More Products from ib Softs</h3>\n<p>👉 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghl-connect/\" rel=\"ugc\">GHL Connect for WooCommerce &#8211; Free</a><br />\n👉 <a href=\"https://www.ibsofts.com/plugins/ghl-connect-for-woocommerce-pro/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GHL Connect for WooCommerce &#8211; Pro</a><br />\n👉 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/go-high-level-extension-for-gravity-form/\" rel=\"ugc\">Go High Level Extension For Gravity Forms &#8211; Free</a><br />\n👉 <a href=\"https://www.ibsofts.com/plugins/go-high-level-extension-for-gravity-forms/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Go High Level Extension For Gravity Forms &#8211; Pro</a><br />\n👉 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/go-high-level-extension-for-contact-form7/\" rel=\"ugc\">Go High Level Extension For Contact Form 7 &#8211; Free</a><br />\n👉 <a href=\"https://www.ibsofts.com/plugins/go-high-level-extension-for-contact-form-7/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Go High Level Extension For Contact Form 7 &#8211; Pro</a><br />\n👉 Go High Level Extension For JotForm &#8211; Free(Coming Soon)<br />\n👉 <a href=\"https://www.ibsofts.com/plugins/go-high-level-extension-for-jotform/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Go High Level Extension For JotForm &#8211; Pro</a><br />\n👉 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/reviews-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"ugc\">Reviews for WooCommerce</a><br />\n👉 For more web services and solutions, please visit <a href=\"https://www.ibarts.co/contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ibarts.co</a></p>\n",

Did I mention, no coding is required 🙂</p>\n<h4>Creating WordPress Landing Pages with SeedProd</h4>\n<p>What are landing pages? A landing page is a standalone web page that a person &#8220;lands&#8221; on after clicking through from an email, ad, or other digital location. Most of the time, these landing pages have a different design from the rest of your site and do not show your website&#8217;s standard header and footer.</p>\n<p>Landing Pages have a particular purpose and desired user action; therefore, you want them to be distraction-free as possible. With SeedProd, it is super easy to create high-converting landing pages for any purpose, that are entirely separate from your website&#8217;s design.</p>\n<p>You can use our Domain Mapping feature to put landings page on their own domain, our Dynamic Text feature to add personalization, or our WooCommerce Blocks to build one-off product pages. These are just a few of the many powerful features SeedProd provides.</p>\n<h4>Building Coming Soon Pages and Maintenance Mode Pages with SeedProd</h4>\n<p>SeedProd allows you to build a coming soon or maintenance mode page that will hide your site from visitors and search engines like Google. You can work on your website in private. When the website uses coming soon mode, the page will be indexed by Google as long as your site is not set to be private in WordPress.</p>\n<p>In Maintenance Mode, we return a 503 header status that lets Google know your site is down for maintenance.</p>\n<p>Both of these modes are essential for any WordPress Website to have.</p>\n<p>The Free Version of SeedProd comes with a variety of Coming Soon Page and Maintenance Mode templates.</p>\n<h3>Full Page Builder Feature List:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress Theme Builder &#8211; Create Headers, Footers, Pages, Posts, Archives, Sidebars, WooCommerce Pages or any part of a WordPress theme with our no-code Theme Builder.</li>\n<li>Fast Drag &amp; Drop Page Builder &#8211; Our page builder is super fast, lightweight and responsive.</li>\n<li>WordPress Themes created with SeedProd work with any page builder.</li>\n<li>Landing Pages work with any WordPress Theme.</li>\n<li>200+ Professionally Designed WordPress Themes, Landing Page Templates &amp; Layout Sections</li>\n<li>80+ Pro Page Blocks &#8211; We have created a variety of blocks to display static and dynamic content.</li>\n<li>Landing Page Templates &#8211; Sale Pages, Coming Soon Pages, Maintenance Mode Pages, Webinar Pages, Giveaway Pages, Thank You Pages, 404 Pages, and Login Pages</li>\n<li>Responsive and Mobile Ready &#8211; Pages created with SeedProd look great on any device.</li>\n<li>Premium Integrations &#8211; Collect emails with your favorite 3rd party email marketing service providers, including MailChimp, ActiveCampaign, ConvertKit, Constant Contact, and more&#8230;</li>\n<li>Subscriber Management &#8211; Track every subscriber with or without a 3rd party email provider.</li>\n<li>Stock Images &#8211; Get In-Plugin Access to over 2 Million Stock Images.

    "description": "<p><strong>Cookie Notice</strong> provides a simple, customizable website banner that can be used to help your website comply with certain cookie consent requirements under the EU GDPR cookie law and CCPA regulations and includes <strong>seamless integration</strong> with Cookie Compliance to help your site comply with the latest updates to existing consent laws.</p>\n<p><strong>Cookie Compliance</strong> is a fully featured Consent Management Platform (CMP) that provides automated compliance features and enhanced design controls in a state-of-the-art web application. Cookie Compliance enables websites to <strong>take a proactive approach to data protection and consent laws</strong>. It is the first solution to offer Intentional Consent, a new consent framework that incorporates the latest guidelines from over 100+ countries, and emerging standards from leading international organizations like the IEEE and European Center for Digital Rights (noyb.eu). Cookie Compliance provides a beautiful, multi-level experience and includes new choices and controls for site visitors to better understand and engage in data privacy decisions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our Cookie Compliance web application introduces a more ethical, proactive way to capture and manage consent.  This early version of the emerging Intentional Consent framework is a result of Hu-manity.co’s ongoing work with top Fortune 500 companies, governments, and standards organizations, who believe that the imbalanced relationship between consumers and corporations is unsustainable when it comes to data privacy and consent online. We are making it available for all website owners and operators who share this belief and support our mission to eliminate the dark patterns in online consent.<br />\n  Matt Sinderbrand &#8211; Chief Platform Officer, Hu-manity.co</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Cookie Notice (plugin only)</h3>\n<p>Cookie Notice provides a simple, customizable website banner to help your website comply with certain cookie consent requirements.</p>\n<h4>Banner features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Customizable notice message</li>\n<li>Consent on click, scroll or close</li>\n<li>Multiple cookie expiry options</li>\n<li>Link to Privacy Policy page</li>\n<li>WordPress Privacy Policy page synchronization</li>\n<li>WPML and Polylang compatible</li>\n<li>SEO friendly</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cookie Compliance (plugin + web application)</h3>\n<p>Cookie Compliance gives you access to the most up-to-date formatting guidelines and technical compliance requirements for over 100 countries and legal jurisdictions.</p>\n<h4>Banner features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intentional Consent</strong> provides 3 equal buttons to give site visitors the ability to accept none, some, or all cookies through packaged choices called Data Access Levels. Data Access Levels improve consent conversion and eliminate the dark pattern of deceptive, non-equal choices in the first layer. <em>Complies with equal choice principle prescribed under GDPR and other data protection laws.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Consent duration selector</strong> gives visitor control over how long their consent remains valid for your site.  <em>Enables your site to align with recent guidelines from EU Data Protection Authorities, which state that cookie consent should be valid for no longer than a period of 6 months.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Cookie purpose categories</strong> make it easy for website visitors to customize their consent by category. <em>Complies with affirmative, opt-in consent requirements prescribed under GDPR and other data protection laws.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Consent metrics</strong> displays the visitor&#8217;s consent record and a list of blocked / allowed 3rd parties directly in the expanded level of the banner. <em>Complies with latest guidance from EU Data Protection Authorities like CNIL (France) and ICO (UK). </em></li>\n<li><strong>Customizable Privacy Paper</strong> provides helpful information to improve visitor comprehension and understanding of the data sharing risks and benefits. Allows you to summarize core components of your sites privacy notice and <em>aligns with the informed principle prescribed by GDPR rules for valid consent capture. </em></li>\n<li><strong>Configurable Privacy Contact</strong> allows you to provide contact information for a business’ data privacy admin, as well as helpful links to data subject request forms and other data privacy resources. <em>Aligns with the informed principle prescribed by GDPR rules for valid consent capture.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Web Application features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consent analytics dashboard</strong> shows event data for number of visits and provides a “trust score” to help you track how site visitors are setting their consent. Make adjustments to your banner to improve your cookie acceptance rate and monitor progress via the consent activity graph.</li>\n<li><strong>Default configurations</strong> for GDPR, CCPA and more help to remove dark patterns and allow for quick and easy deployment of the consent banner without any guesswork. Customize the design of any default configuration to match the look and feel of your site.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic script blocking</strong> blocks all non-essential cookie scripts and iFrames by default and <em>complies with valid consent rules under GDPR and other data protection laws</em>; in order to be compliant, your site must record visitor consent before setting or sending cookies.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Consent Mode</strong> ensures that your website can still gather valuable insights and perform effectively while respecting users&#8217; privacy preferences by <em>dynamically adjusting the behavior of Google services according to user consent.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Facebook Consent Mode</strong> allows your website to <em>measure the impact of your ads on Facebook</em>, track website activities and conversions and automatically deliver ads to Facebook if the user has agreed to.</li>\n<li><strong>Consent record storage</strong> automatically stores a record of each consent and makes these records available for export. <em>Complies with proof-of-consent requirements prescribed under GDPR and other data protection laws.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Multilingual support</strong> automatically translates all banner text strings and allows you to provide custom translations for every text field to ensure visitors get a consistent consent experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Multidomain management</strong> allows you to manage additional Free or Professional domains under a single account and enables you to customize banner configuration and design for each domain independently.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cookie Compliance proactive approach:</h4>\n<p>For all businesses, the resources required to stay ahead of the latest regulations increases with the passage of each new law. With enforcement of compliance violations increasing daily, we believe it is critical for us as a trusted consent vendor to do everything in our power to help you stay ahead of these laws and remove the risk to your business</p>\n<p><strong>Cookie Compliance covers all current and upcoming regulations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>GDPR (EU)</li>\n<li>ePrivacy Directive (EU)</li>\n<li>ePrivacy Regulation (EU)</li>\n<li>PECR (UK)</li>\n<li>LGPD (Brazil)</li>\n<li>PIPEDA (Canada)</li>\n<li>PDPB (India)</li>\n<li>CCPA (California, US)</li>\n<li>VCDPA (Virginia, US)</li>\n<li>Colorado Privacy Act (US)</li>\n<li>CPRA (California, US)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cookie Compliance incorporates all recent formatting guidance:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)</li>\n<li>ICO (United Kingdom)</li>\n<li>CNIL (France)</li>\n<li>GPDP (Italy)</li>\n<li>BfDl (Germany)</li>\n<li>AEPD (Spain)</li>\n<li>European Center for Digital Rights (noyb.eu)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cookie Compliance targets dark patterns</strong></p>\n<p>Dark Patterns are user interface (UI) techniques that push site visitors to make decisions (such as agreeing to the installation of cookies on their devices) that they might not otherwise make.

With just one click, users can copy a direct link to the section for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bookmarking the heading so they can continue reading later without scrolling.</li>\n<li>Sharing specific sections of content with friends, colleagues, or on social media.</li>\n<li>Quickly navigating to a specific part of a long article or documentation.</li>\n<li>Enhancing accessibility by enabling deep linking to specific sections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin is designed to be lightweight and user-friendly. It is perfect for blogs, documentation sites, WooCommerce stores, and any site with long-form content.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a link icon next to the selected heading levels (H2, H3, etc.).</li>\n<li>Supports posts, pages, and custom post types.</li>\n<li>Customizable heading levels to display the link icon.</li>\n<li>Compatible with WooCommerce product pages and other custom post types.</li>\n<li>Generates anchor links, section links, and deep links for improved navigation.</li>\n<li>Simple settings page for quick configuration.</li>\n<li>Lightweight and optimized for performance.</li>\n<li>Option to always show the copy link to the heading icon for mobile devices</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How Links are Generated</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin automatically generates anchor links for headings on the frontend when the page loads. No changes are required in the WordPress editor or post content.</li>\n<li>If a heading already has an anchor link, the plugin uses the existing anchor link URL for the &#8220;copy link&#8221; functionality.<br />\nEven if the heading text is modified later, the plugin dynamically regenerates the anchor link based on the updated heading text on the front end. This ensures that any changes made in the editor will not cause issues with link functionality.  </li>\n<li>This seamless approach ensures the plugin adapts to changes in content while maintaining reliable and accurate linking.</li>\n<li>So just install the &#8220;Copy Link to Heading&#8221; plugin on your WordPres website and configure the settings based on your preference to decide on which all content types and headings levels you want to show the copy link to the heading icon. </li>\n<li>Everything will be done in the frontend out of box by our plugin without any hussle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use Cases:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Copy links to specific headings</strong> using a heading URL generator to share with others or reference in emails or social media.</li>\n<li><strong>Bookmark sections of long articles or documentation</strong> for easy navigation later.</li>\n<li><strong>Enable deep linking</strong> to improve user experience on content-heavy websites.</li>\n<li>Help readers and collaborators quickly access key sections of your content with a bookmark link generator.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re managing a blog, a technical documentation site, or a WooCommerce store, this plugin ensures your audience can easily navigate and share content.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>This plugin allows you to set a custom alternative text to each instance of an image widget that you add to a post or page using the Elementor Editor. You can also use the attachment alternative text (as default) or even set the alt text empty (for decorative images).</p>\n<h4>Why you will love this plugin</h4>\n<p>The plugin <strong>Custom Alt Text for Elementor Images</strong> is a great solution for WordPress websites whose owners want complete control over the alt text of their images. This powerful plugin adds options to the Elementor Image Widget, allowing you to set alternative text one of three ways: 1 &#8211; add custom alt text for the image instance, 2 &#8211; use the attachment alt text as set in the media library, or 3 &#8211; choose not to add alt text at all. Without this plugin you would need to upload an image into the media library each time you wanted different or custom alternative text for the image, but this plugin allows you to use the same instance of the image repeatedly, with custom alternative text for each instance.</p>\n<p>Using this plugin, you can improve the accessibility and SEO of your website&#8217;s images by choosing the appropriate text each time you add an image to the page, per <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">guidance from the W3C</a>. The W3C alt text decision tree, created by W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), helps you determine the appropriate alt text for your images based on their context and purpose. By using this decision tree in conjunction with <strong>Custom Alt Text for Elementor Images</strong>, you can ensure that your images are properly described and accessible to all users, as appropriate.</p>\n<p>That’s why we created this plugin. <strong>Now you will have full control over the alternative text of your Image widgets.</strong></p>\n<h3>How to use it</h3>\n<p>Simply add an <strong>Image widget</strong> to your post or page using the <strong>Elementor Editor</strong> and you will find the new settings under the <strong>Link</strong> field on the <strong>Content <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Image</strong> in the <strong>Elementor Panel</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Alternative Text</strong> field is set by default to <strong>&#8220;Attachment Alt Text&#8221;</strong>, that means that the image will use the default Attachment alternative text (this is the default behavior of Elementor). But now you can also set it to <strong>&#8220;None&#8221;</strong> (if your image is decorative) or <strong>&#8220;Custom&#8221;</strong> (in that case, a new field will appear where you can set your custom text).</p>\n",

So you can continue using plugins and theme functions that extend the Classic Editor. Supports awesome features like Meta Boxes, Quicktags, Custom Fields, and everything else the Classic Editor can do.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does not &#8220;expire&#8221; in 2022! 🙂</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Easy to Use</strong></p>\n<p>Just activate and done!

    "description": "<p>Google Tag Manager (GTM) is Google&#8217;s free tool for everyone to manage and deploy analytics and marketing tags as well as other code snippets<br />\nusing an intuitive web UI. To learn more about this tool, visit the <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official website</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin places the GTM container code snippets onto your WordPress website so that you do not need to add it manually.<br />\nMultiple containers are also supported!</p>\n<p>The plugin complements your GTM setup by pushing page meta data and user information into the so called data layer.<br />\nGoogle&#8217;s official help pages includes <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer#datalayer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">more details about the data layer</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>PHP 7.4 is required to use this plugin.</strong></p>\n<h4>GTM container code placement</h4>\n<p>The original GTM container code is divided into two parts:</p>\n<p>The first part is a javascript code snippet that is added to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of every page of the website.<br />\nThis part is critical to enable all features of GTM, and this plugin helps to place this part<br />\ncorrectly on your site.</p>\n<p>The second part is an iframe snippet that acts as a failsafe/fallback should users&#8217; JavaScript be disabled.<br />\nGoogle recommends – for best performance – to place this code snippet directly after the opening <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag on each page.</p>\n<p>Albeit not ideal, it will work when placed lower in the code. This plugin provides a code placement option for the second code snippet.</p>\n<p>If your WordPress theme is compatible with the additions of WordPress 5.2 then this plugin will place this second code to the right place.<br />\nUsers of the Genisis theme, GeneratePress theme, Elementor, Oxygen Builder and Beaver Builder Theme will also have this placed correctly.<br />\nTo utilize this, set the compatibility mode in plugin options to off.</p>\n<p>All other users can place this second code snippet using a custom PHP code (&#8220;Manually coded&#8221; option) or select the so called &#8220;Footer&#8221; option to<br />\nadd the code lower in the code (it is not the recommended way but will work)</p>\n<h4>Basic data included</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>post/page titles</li>\n<li>post/page dates</li>\n<li>post/page category names</li>\n<li>post/page tag names</li>\n<li>post/page author ID and name</li>\n<li>post/page ID</li>\n<li>post types</li>\n<li>post format</li>\n<li>post count on the current page + in the current category/tag/taxonomy</li>\n<li>custom terms associated with any post type</li>\n<li>logged in status</li>\n<li>logged in user role</li>\n<li>logged in user ID (to track cross device behaviour in Google Analytics)</li>\n<li>logged in user email address (both unhashed and SHA256 hased values to be used with tracking)</li>\n<li>logger in user creation date</li>\n<li>site search data</li>\n<li>site name and id (for WordPress multisite instances)</li>\n<li>IP address of the visitor (please use the explicit consent of the visitor to utilize this)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Browser / OS / Device data</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>browser data (name, version, engine)</li>\n<li>OS data (name, version)</li>\n<li>device data (type, manufacturer, model)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data is provided using the WhichBrowser library: http://whichbrowser.net/</p>\n<h4>Weather data</h4>\n<p>(beta)</p>\n<p>Push data about users&#8217; current weather conditions into the dataLayer. This can be used to generate weather-related<br />\naudience/remarketing lists on ad platforms and allows for user segmentation in your web analytics solutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>weather category (clouds, rain, snow, etc.)</li>\n<li>weather description: more detailed data</li>\n<li>temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit</li>\n<li>air pressure</li>\n<li>wind speed and degrees</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Weather data is queried from Open Weather Map. Depending on your websites traffic, additional fees may apply:<br />\nhttp://openweathermap.org/price</p>\n<p>An (free) API key from OpenWeatherMap is required for this feature to work.</p>\n<p>ipstack.com is used to determine the site visitor&#8217;s location. A (free) API key from IPStack.com is required for this feature to work:<br />\nhttps://ipstack.com/product</p>\n<h4>Media player events</h4>\n<p>(experimental)</p>\n<p>Track users&#8217; interaction with any embedded media:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>YouTube</li>\n<li>Vimeo</li>\n<li>Soundcloud</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DataLayer events can be chosen to fire upon media player load, media is being played, paused/stopped and optionally when<br />\nthe user reaches 10, 20, 30, &#8230;, 90, 100% of the media duration.</p>\n<p>Tracking is supported for embedded media using the built-in oEmbed feature of WordPress as well as most other media plugins<br />\nand copy/pasted codes. Players injected into the website after page load are not currently supported.</p>\n<h4>Scroll tracking</h4>\n<p>Fire tags based on how the visitor scrolls from the top to the bottom of a page.<br />\nAn example would be to separate &#8220;readers&#8221; (who spend a specified amount of time on a page) from &#8220;scrollers&#8221;<br />\n(who only scroll through within seconds). You can use these events to fire Analytics tags and/or remarketing/conversion tags<br />\n(for micro conversions).</p>\n<p>Scroll tracking is based on the solution originally created by</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nick Mihailovski</li>\n<li>Thomas Baekdal</li>\n<li>Avinash Kaushik</li>\n<li>Joost de Valk</li>\n<li>Eivind Savio</li>\n<li>Justin Cutroni</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Original script:<br />\nhttp://cutroni.com/blog/2012/02/21/advanced-content-tracking-with-google-analytics-part-1/</p>\n<h4>Blacklist &amp; Whitelist Tag Manager tags, triggers and variables</h4>\n<p>To increase website security, you have the option to white- and blacklist tags/triggers/variables.<br />\nYou can prevent specific tags from firing or the use of certain variable types regardless of your GTM setup.</p>\n<p>If the Google account associated with your GTM account is being hacked, an attacker could easily<br />\nexecute malware on your website without accessing its code on your hosting server. By blacklisting custom HTML tags<br />\nand/or custom JavaScript variables you can secure the Tag Manager container.</p>\n<h4>Integration</h4>\n<p>Google Tag Manager for WordPress integrates with several popular plugins. More integration to come!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact Form 7: fire an event when a Contact Form 7 form was submitted with any result (mail sent, mail failed, spam detected, invalid input)</li>\n<li>WooCommerce:\n<ul>\n<li>Implementation of <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/ecommerce-ga4\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GA4 E-commerce</a></li>\n<li>Does not support promotions since WooCommerce does not have such a feature (yet)</li>\n<li>Does not support refunds</li>\n<li>Compatibility with High Performance Order Storage (HPOS)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>AMP: load your AMP container on the AMP version of your pages</li>\n<li>Cookiebot: use automatic cookie blocking mode if needed</li>\n<li>Google Consent Mode v2: fire the &#8220;default&#8221; command with specific consent flags to integrat with non-certified Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) and plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Server side containers</h4>\n<p>If you are using a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/serverside/send-data#update_the_gtmjs_source_domain\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">server side container</a><br />\nyou can enter your custom domain name and custom path to load gtm.js from your there.</p>\n<h4>Exclude specific user roles from being tracked</h4>\n<p>You can set which user roles needs to be excluded from tracking when a user with that role visits the frontend. This will completely disable the container code for that user.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p><strong>Compatible with PHP 8.2</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Like this plugin?

No problem. You can skip entering a selector on the settings page and call the jQuery script yourself using one of two functions:</p>\n<pre><code>jQuery( '.selector' ).initEqualHeights();\n\n// Or\n\njQuery( '.selector' ).equalizeTheHeights();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The difference between these two functions is simply that <code>initEqualHeights()</code> will set up all the events for recalculating the heights when the window is resized or the global <code>equalheights</code> event is triggered, but <code>equalizeTheHeights()</code> will simply equalize the heights without involving any events.</p>\n<p>Both functions take three optional arguments, the minimum height (number of pixels), maximum height, and the breakpoint (below which the heights will revert to their original size):</p>\n<pre><code>jQuery( '.selector' ).initEqualHeights( minHeight, maxHeight, breakPoint );\n</code></pre>\n<p>So an example might look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>jQuery( '.selector' ).initEqualHeights( 200, 500, 768 );\n</code></pre>\n<p>When entering a selector on the settings page or using the <code>initEqualHeights()</code> method this plugin also adds an event &#8216;equalheights&#8217; to the window, allowing you to easily trigger the equalizing manually. This is useful if you have added new items to the page after it loads via AJAX. You can trigger the event like this:</p>\n<pre><code>jQuery( window ).trigger( 'equalheights' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another option for controlling which elements get equalized is the <code>equal_height_columns_elements</code> filter. This filter operates on the array of data that gets passed to the JS right before it is passed. This allows for developers to specify selectors that can&#8217;t be deleted from the settings page, and for programmaticly building selectors based on dynamic data. Here&#8217;s an example of how the filter can be used:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'equal_height_columns_elements', 'custom_ehc_elements' );\nfunction custom_ehc_elements( $elements ) {\n\n    $elements['element-groups']['custom'] = array(\n        'selector'   =&gt; '.ehc-target', // Selector goes here.\n        'breakpoint' =&gt; '768',\n    );\n\n    return $elements;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The keys on the <code>element-groups</code> array used by selectors entered on the settings page will come in as numbered indexes, so to avoid collision it&#8217;s best to use named keys for any custom selectors (we&#8217;re using &#8216;custom&#8217; in the example above, but any unique string will work).</p>\n<p>This plugin is <a href=\"https://github.com/MIGHTYminnow/equal-height-columns\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on Github</a> and pull requests are always welcome.</p>\n<h4>NEW: Multi rows</h4>\n<p>On version <strong>1.2.0</strong> we are introducing a new feature <em>(for now, only available via JavaScript)</em> that resolves a common issue if the row number of certain elements varies across breakpoints when the number of columns change.</p>\n<p>For example, if we have 2 columns for tablets and 3 columns for desktops, the third element in the group would be positioned on the second row for tablets but on the first row for desktops.</p>\n<p>Before this new feature, the equal height would be based on all the elements from the group. Now you can have &#8220;subgroups&#8221; for each row, and recalculate when the number of columns in the rows change.</p>\n<p>To use this new feature add the function once per breakpoint:</p>\n<pre><code>jQuery( document ).equalHeight( selector, columns, minWidth, maxWidth );\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>selector:</strong> The selector of the group of elements that you want to apply the equal height.</p>\n<p><strong>columns:</strong> The number of columns per row on the breakpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>minWidth:</strong> The minimum width of the breakpoint. Use 1 for mobile.</p>\n<p><strong>maxWidth:</strong> The maximum width of the breakpoint. You can leave empty for the biggest breakpoint.</p>\n<p>The following example would apply equal height for headings with the class <strong>.demo-heading</strong> in a grid that has 1 column per row on mobile, 2 columns on tablet and 3 columns on desktop:</p>\n<pre><code>$( document ).equalHeight( '.demo-heading', 1, 1, 767 ); // 1 columns for 1px - 767px\n$( document ).equalHeight( '.demo-heading', 2, 768, 1024 ); // 2 columns for 768px - 1024px\n$( document ).equalHeight( '.demo-heading', 3, 1025 ); // 3 columns for 1025px (and above)\n</code></pre>\n",

    "short_description": "Smaller Images, Faster Sites, Happier Visitors. Comprehensive image optimization that doesn&#039;t require a degree in rocket science.",
    "description": "<p>Are you frustrated by a slow website? Do over-sized images make you say &#8220;ewww&#8221;&#8230; Let EWWW Image Optimizer help you make your site faster, improve your bounce rate, and boost your SEO. But most importantly, make your visitors happier so they keep coming back for more.</p>\n<p>With EWWW IO you can optimize all your existing images, <a href=\"https://docs.ewww.io/article/84-plugin-compatibility\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">from any plugin</a>, and then let EWWW IO take care of new image uploads automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Why use EWWW Image Optimizer?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>No Speed Limits</strong> and <a href=\"https://ewww.io/unlimited-file-size/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">unlimited file size</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Smooth Handling</strong> with pixel-perfect optimization using industry-leading tools and progressive rendering.</li>\n<li><strong>High Torque</strong> as we bring you the best compression/quality ratio available with our Premium compression for JPG, PNG, SVG, WebP, and PDF files.</li>\n<li><strong>Adaptive Steering</strong> with intelligent conversion options to get the right image format for the job (JPG, PNG, GIF, AVIF, or WebP).</li>\n<li><strong>Free Parking</strong> The core plugin is free and always will be. However, our paid services offer up to 80% compression, and a <a href=\"https://ewww.io/plans/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">host of other features</a>!</li>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive Coverage:</strong> no image gets left behind, optimize everything on your site, not just the WordPress Media Library.</li>\n<li><strong>Safety First:</strong> all communications are secured with top SSL encryption.</li>\n<li><strong>Roadside Assistance:</strong> top-notch support is in our DNA. While API customers get top priority, we answer <a href=\"https://ewww.io/contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">every single support question with care</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Pack a Spare:</strong> free image backups store your original images for 30 days.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>EWWW IO is the only plugin that lets you optimize images using tools on your own server (jpegtran, optipng, pngout, pngquant, gifsicle, cwebp). If you feel the need for more speed, get more compression and offload the CPU-intensive process of optimization to <a href=\"https://ewww.io/plans/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our specialized servers</a>.</p>\n<h4>Automatic Everything</h4>\n<p>With Easy IO, images are automatically compressed, scaled to fit the page and device size, lazy loaded, and converted to next-gen WebP and AVIF formats.</p>\n<h4>Support</h4>\n<p>Stuck? Feeling like maybe you DO need that rocket science degree? <a href=\"https://ewww.io/contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">We provide free one-on-one email support to everyone</a>.<br />\nDo you have an idea to make EWWW IO even better? <a href=\"https://feedback.ewww.io/b/features\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Share it and vote on future features</a>!</p>\n<p>Found a bug? Report the issue on <a href=\"https://github.com/nosilver4u/ewww-image-optimizer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>, and we&#8217;ll get it fixed!</p>\n<p>You may report security issues through our Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team helps validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/ewww-image-optimizer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Report a security vulnerability.</a></p>\n<h4>Bulk Optimize</h4>\n<p>Optimize all your images from a single page. This includes the Media Library, your theme, and a handful of pre-configured folders (see Optimize Everything Else below). GRAND FlaGallery, NextCellent and NextGEN have their own Bulk Optimize pages.</p>\n<h4>Optimize Everything Else</h4>\n<p>Configure any folder within your WordPress install to be optimized. The Bulk Optimizer will compress theme images, BuddyPress avatars, BuddyPress Activity Plus images, Meta Slider slides, WP Symposium Pro avatars, GD bbPress attachments, Grand Media Galleries, and any user-specified folders. You can also use Scheduled optimization or run the optimizer from WP-CLI if that&#8217;s more your thing.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Compatibility</h4>\n<p>EWWW IO has been tested with hundreds (if not thousands) of <a href=\"https://docs.ewww.io/article/84-plugin-compatibility\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugins and themes</a>, here are just a few of the most common ones: BuddyPress (Activity Plus add-on too), Cloudinary, Easy Watermark, FileBird, FooGallery, GD bbPress Attachments, GRAND FlAGallery, Gmedia Photo Gallery, MediaPress, Meta Slider, Microsoft Azure Storage, MyArcadePlugin, NextGEN Gallery, Regenerate Thumbnails, <a href=\"https://weglot.com/integrations/wordpress-translation-plugin/demo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Weglot</a>, WP Offload Media, <a href=\"https://wpml.org/plugin/ewww-image-optimizer/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPML</a>, WP Retina 2x, WP RSS Aggregator, WP Symposium. <a href=\"https://docs.ewww.io/article/84-plugin-compatibility\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more&#8230;</a></p>\n<h4>WebP Images</h4>\n<p>If you want simple, get automatic WebP conversion with Easy IO, and be done with it! Otherwise, you can generate WebP versions of your images with the Bulk Optimizer, and deliver them to supported browsers. Take your pick between Apache-style rewrite rules, JS WebP Rewriting, and  WebP Rewriting. EWWW IO even works with the WebP option in the Cache Enabler plugin from KeyCDN.</p>\n<h4>AVIF Images</h4>\n<p>AVIF conversion is built into the Easy IO CDN. Once your site is setup with Easy IO, edit the site settings to enable AVIF, and you&#8217;re done!</p>\n<h4>WP-CLI</h4>\n<p>Allows you to run all Bulk Optimization processes from your command line, instead of the web interface. It is much faster, and allows you to do things like run it in &#8216;screen&#8217; or via regular cron (instead of wp-cron, which can be unpredictable on low-traffic sites). Install WP-CLI from wp-cli.org, and run &#8216;wp-cli.phar help ewwwio optimize&#8217; for more information or see the <a href=\"https://docs.ewww.io/article/25-optimizing-with-wp-cli\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>CDN Support</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Offload Media</a> is the officially supported (and recommended) plugin for uploads to Amazon S3, Digital Ocean Spaces, and Google Cloud Storage. <a href=\"https://docs.ewww.io/article/84-plugin-compatibility\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Check our compatibility list for details on other plugins</a>. All pull mode CDNs like Cloudflare, KeyCDN, MaxCDN, and Sucuri CloudProxy work automatically, but will require you to purge the cache after a bulk optimization.</p>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>Huge thanks to all our translators, <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/contributors\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">see the full list</a>!</p>\n<p>If you would like to help translate this plugin, <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/ewww-image-optimizer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">join the team</a>.<br />\n<a href=\"https://ewww.io/register/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Signup to receive updates when new strings are available for translation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p>Written by <a href=\"https://ewww.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shane Bishop</a> with special thanks to my <a href=\"https://www.iamsecond.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Lord and Savior</a>.

    "description": "<p>The FFL checkout tool allows you to sell firearms online and ship them to a licensed dealer. For online firearm orders that require transfers to FFL dealers, FFL checkout facilitates the process for you (the firearm dealer) AND your customers, allowing them to select the dealer of their choice!</p>\n<p>It provides customers with an easy-to-use search tool that includes a map and a zip code search. We have access to the most accurate data and the most up-to-date database of FFL, complete with PDFs if they are verified.</p>\n<p>We used the most advanced address look-up software to provide accurate FFL locations for the customer. FFLs are either verified or not. If they are, we have the PDF and all the information on file ready to be downloaded from FFLs.com. If our database does not have the FFL the customer is using, they can upload a current copy, which is attached to the order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We provide your customers with a list of FFL dealers to whom they can ship their firearms for pickup. </li>\n<li>If we don&#8217;t have their preferred FFL in our database, we will allow them to upload it.  </li>\n<li>For you, the online store owner, we send you the selected FFL dealer information along with a digital copy of its license for you to verify and keep on file.  </li>\n<li>The FFL is attached to the order, and we have a link for you to check its status on the Ezcheck system.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Handle selling guns and making transfers more efficiently while boosting sales with quicker customer checkout and reduced cart abandonment rate.</p>\n<p>This plugin is supported by FFLs.com, which is part of Fastbound. They have the largest, most complete database of FFLs and the best data system that scans the ATF FFL database weekly and updates FFL information (including FFL documents) in real time as the information is received.</p>\n<h3>How much does the Plugin cost</h3>\n<p>Our pricing is simple: $99.99 per site per year. Use as many queries as needed, and allow customers unlimited uploads, which we will add to the database!</p>\n<h3>How the Plugin Works</h3>\n<p>When a product has the FFL required option enabled, the FFL checkout block will be displayed to the client during the checkout process. The client can choose an FFL (Federal Firearms License) holder. The admin can later view the chosen FFL details, verified using the FFLS.com API, using the order details.</p>\n<h3>Why is this plug better than the other alternatives?</h3>\n<p>Easy to use, Easy to set up Gun industry experts and pro 2A friends of the industry built it; this is not an overpriced complex system as other companies push. We don’t mess with costly third-party anti-gun clouds – we don’t need them. We own and operate our servers; we have a cloud, but we own it. We own and operate our hosting environment so that nothing gets banned or shut down. This means that downtime will be minimal, and performance will be consistent. Did I mention that it&#8217;s the cheapest online solution with the most features?</p>\n<h3>How to Bulk Update Products to be FFL Required</h3>\n<p>To bulk update products to be marked as FFL required, navigate to the product management section of your WordPress admin dashboard. Select the products you wish to update, choose the bulk action to edit, and set the FFL required option.</p>\n<h3>What is an FFL?</h3>\n<p>A Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) is an individual or a business entity that has obtained a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), a U.S. Department of Justice branch. This license grants them legal authorization to engage in the commercial sale, manufacture, or importation of firearms and ammunition.</p>\n<p>Having an FFL implies that the licensee has undergone a thorough vetting process and is subject to stringent government regulations to ensure that firearms transactions are conducted lawfully and responsibly. This includes maintaining comprehensive records of firearm acquisitions and dispositions, conducting background checks on prospective buyers to verify eligibility, and adhering to specific security and reporting requirements. FFLs.com helps your customers find an FFL near them quickly at checkout!</p>\n<p>All online firearm dealers have an FFL and want to ensure the sale and shipment of their products are executed safely while adhering to all U.S. laws and regulations. The Texas Technology Group has built a system that simplifies your online sales. In addition to helping customers through the FFL selection and checkout process, we built features for the dealer to optimize their fulfillment process. On the order details page, you will see an FFL Download link, which will connect you to FFLs.com and allow you to download the FFL. We also provided a quick and easy ezCheck link to verify the data instantly.</p>\n<h3>Contact Information</h3>\n<p>TEXAS TECHNOLOGY GROUP<br />\nAddress: 2802 Timmons Ln #27446, Houston, TX 77027<br />\nPhone: (713) 824-1035<br />\nEmail: cs@texastechnologygroup.com<br />\nWebsite: www.texastechnologygroup.com</p>\n<h3>External libraries/services</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://leafletjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Leaflet.js</a> &#8211; open-source library for mobile-friendly interactive maps <a href=\"https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/main/LICENSE\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Check license</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ffls.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FFLs.com</a> &#8211; FFL data for the checkout block</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Texas technology group FFL checkout <a href=\"https://ffl-checkout-api.texastechnologygroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">API</a> &#8211;  Provides data for checkout block, allows licenses uploads</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

Through an advanced Machine Learning approach, it can detect and block malicious accesses to the system, notify the legitimate user and the system administrator about such access attempts.</p>\n<p>Beyond the security, the GuardianKey solution provides a good user experience, because the user is not required to provide extra information or to execute tasks during the login.</p>\n<p>GuardianKey&#8217;s approach provides a risk assessment in real-time.

    "description": "<h4>Unlock more revenue with ID verification</h4>\n<p>Real ID digitally proves your customer’s real identities using a photo ID and facial biometrics. Now you can fulfill any order with confidence. It&#8217;s a perfect use case for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completing orders with age restrictions</li>\n<li>Selling high cost goods</li>\n<li>Vetting customers renting goods</li>\n<li>Validating customers in high risk markets like alcohol, cannabis, vaping and smoking accessories</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Real ID&#8217;s document verification helps remove friction during fulfillment quickly and easily detecting whether a government-issued ID is genuine or fraudulent. All the user needs to do is take a photo of their ID and a selfie on their mobile device.</p>\n<h4>Fraud Detection apps rely on incomplete information</h4>\n<p>Existing anti-fraud tools rely on small pieces of a customer&#8217;s identity like email, IP address &amp; billing information. This doesn&#8217;t give a perfect picture of your customer, and leads to false flags of paying customers. In blocking potentially fraudulent purchases, you also stop some legitimate ones.</p>\n<p>Real ID&#8217;s identity verification solution lets you verify legitimate users caught in the crossfire, and unlock more revenue.</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>Real ID uses cutting edge A.I. to verify the authenticity of the ID and instantly match the face on the ID to the submitted selfie by the customer.</p>\n<p>That way, even if a fraudster had access to a stolen physical ID, they can&#8217;t beat an ID check.</p>\n<h4>How does ID verification help your business?</h4>\n<p>With your customers&#8217; verified ID &amp; selfie photos, you&#8217;re able to prove their shipping address. This gives you far more weight on your side of the court during chargeback disputes. Even further, this practice totally eliminates &#8220;friendly fraud&#8221; losses.</p>\n<p>And if you need to do age verification checks for purchases of restricted goods &#8211; Real ID&#8217;s document verification takes care of that too. We’ll confirm a user’s date of birth by verifying their ID to help you manage and reduce risks at checkout.</p>\n<h4>We handle the GDPR compliance</h4>\n<p>You won&#8217;t have to worry about GDPR compliance either, no data is stored on your end. We securely store all IDs and respect all data deletion requests.</p>\n<h4>We cover hundreds of countries around the world</h4>\n<p>Expand your market with confidence knowing that Real ID can verify hundreds of countries ID&#8217;s including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>United States</li>\n<li>Canada</li>\n<li>Great Britain</li>\n<li>Mexico</li>\n<li>China</li>\n<li>Australia</li>\n<li>Japan</li>\n<li>Germany</li>\n<li>Russia</li>\n<li>And much more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Real ID can verify documents such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Passports</li>\n<li>Drivers Licenses</li>\n<li>National IDs</li>\n<li>Visas</li>\n<li>And much more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Setting up document or biometric verification on your platform will help you make sure the user trying to make a purchase is legitimate—and not a fraudster.</p>\n",

Image Optimizer supports many popular formats, including  JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, and GIF.</p>\n<h4>REDUCED FILE SIZES FOR BOOSTED PERFORMANCE</h4>\n<p>Image Optimizer ensures faster loading times, enhanced user experience, and overall boosted website performance by reducing the size of your website&#8217;s images, resulting in improved Core Web Vitals and search engine rankings. With the Image Optimizer’s exceptional capabilities and unique algorithms, you can fine tune images and reduce their file sizes while retaining quality with lossless or lossy compression.</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Image formats supported</strong> include JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF and GIF.</li>\n<li><strong>Works in the background</strong>: The only plugin in the category that optimizes your images in the background, without you having to stay on the page during optimization.</li>\n<li><strong>Resize large images</strong>: The user can set a maximum pixel width, after which images will automatically be resized. (default value set to 1920px)</li>\n<li><strong>2 compression levels</strong>:  Lossless &#8211; highest quality with minimal compression; Lossy &#8211; maximum compression with somewhat reduced quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimize on upload</strong>: Automatically optimizes images when you upload them.</li>\n<li><strong>Bulk or individual optimization</strong>: Flexible image optimization options, whether it&#8217;s on-demand scaling and compression, or bulk optimization for your entire image library.</li>\n<li><strong>EXIF Metadata</strong>: Select whether to clear image metadata to reduce size even further without impacting image quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Backup original images</strong>: Ability to delete backups permanently to save space. (We recommend backing up your website beforehand.)</li>\n<li><strong>Restore original images</strong> (all sizes) for selected media files if needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Convert to WebP and AVIF</strong>: Get efficient and faster-loading formats with WebP  and AVIF for even better web performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Image thumbnails</strong>: Resize all image sizes by default. Allow the user to choose specific image sizes based on WordPress-registered thumbnail sizes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>BULK OR SINGLE IMAGE OPTIMIZATION</h4>\n<p>Image Optimizer by Elementor lets you optimize all images in your library either one at a time, or in a batch according to your preferences and settings. Easily configure the plugin to scale or compress your images on-demand, or automatically have them triggered as they are being uploaded. Or, if you have a large number of images already uploaded, the bulk optimization feature allows you to resize and/or compress your entire library of existing images in just a few clicks.</p>\n<h4>2 COMPRESSION LEVELS</h4>\n<p>With Image Optimizer’s advanced algorithms, you can compress images and reduce their file size at the level that makes the most sense for you. We offer 2 types of compression where images will be processed, giving you the perfect balance of compression and quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Lossless Compression</strong>: Lossless compression reduces image file sizes without sacrificing or diminishing the quality of your images. This type of compression reduces file sizes by removing unused or unnecessary data so that no image details are lost along the way.  Hence, you are able to reduce the file size and still maintain the quality of your image.</p>\n<p><strong>Lossy Compression</strong>: Lossy compression performs maximum compression resulting in lightweight images and smaller file sizes. It reduces image size by removing image data that is generally invisible to the human eye and minimizes any compromise in image quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Convert to WebP and AVIF</strong>: Convert images to the slimmer WebP or AVIF formats for even better optimization with a 25-30% savings over JPEG and PNG. Most browsers support WebP, however if they don’t, you can have fallback versions of the image available in the same format as the original image.</p>\n<p>By tailoring compression to the level you need, your visitors will enjoy faster load times, improved responsiveness, and a seamless browsing experience. Our approach also enables your website to rank higher in search results. Since a search engine&#8217;s ranking is heavily influenced by speed, user experience, and Core Web Vitals, Image Optimizer by Elementor is an invaluable tool for any website, especially one that’s abundant with images.</p>\n<h4>Get Started Today</h4>\n<p>For more information about Image Optimizer, visit our <a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-product-page/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official website</a> or <a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-free-trial/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Try It Now</a>.<br />\nIf you have any questions or need support, feel free to <a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact us</a> or visit our <a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-help-center/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help center</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin requires a connection to an active Elementor account in order to identify the user and provide the user with the purchased service.

This flow is triggered by the user or automatically (based on the selected plugin settings) on compatible image upload or by manually initiating optimize process.</p>\n<h3>Related Plugins</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/site-mailer/\" rel=\"ugc\">Site Mailer</a>: Effortlessly manage transactional emails with Site Mailer.

By default, WordPress generates 5 thumbnails:<br />\n– Thumbnail<br />\n– Medium<br />\n– Medium-large<br />\n– Large<br />\n– Scaled</p>\n<p>Along with this, your themes and plugins add more thumbnails and most of these thumbnails remain unused.</p>\n<p>The result?

Just install the plugin and choose which of the image sizes you want to prevent from generating.</p>\n<h4>🚀 Regenerate Thumbnails</h4>\n<p>Regenerate thumbnails on your WordPress site at any moment, regardless of their sizes.

Our feature allows you to customize these parameters according to your website requirements and prevent oversized images from slowing down your site.</p>\n<h4>🚀 Convert Images to WebP</h4>\n<p>In WordPress convert images to WebP in bulk or one by one without any effort. Convert JPG or PNG to WebP from the comfort of your favorite WordPress dashboard and upgrade your website’s performance without sacrificing image quality. This advanced function ensures your images remain crisp and clear while reducing file size compared to traditional formats. The image conversion to WebP format helps you in SEO and gets you better rankings as Google recommends this format.</p>\n<h4>🚀 Disable Right Click on Image</h4>\n<p>Disable the right-click function on your website, a simple yet effective way to deter visitors from downloading or copying your images and thumbnails.

You are able to resize and compress images from the most common image formats as well as PDF format. In case you have many images to optimize, you can also resize images in bulk thanks to our async bulk optimization option. In just one click, you will be able to compress multiple images super easily. Imagify compresses all your images in the background, so you can leave the page and not worry about anything.</p>\n<p>Many of your high-quality images may be in sizes that are much too large. To reduce image size and compress large images, Imagify has a setting that allows you to choose a maximum width for all of your images, and if you upload images that are larger than that size, it will resize large images for you during optimization. Imagify will resize images proportionally without cropping them.</p>\n<p>With such a great image optimizer like Imagify, you’ll get your images automatically optimized at the best compression level and quality – thanks to the Smart Compression Mode.</p>\n<p>When using our image compression tool, Imagify, you will enjoy smaller file sizes and faster loading times. But the best part is that you will optimise images and reduce their weight without losing quality: why should you have to choose between beauty and speed? If you want to compress images, it’s now easier than ever with Imagify!</p>\n<h4>Convert Images to the WebP and AVIF Formats</h4>\n<p>Thanks to Imagify, you can take a step further in your image optimization process. You can also convert all your images to next-gen image formats such as WebP and AVIF. WebP format, as well as the AVIF format, offers superior image compression and quality and is a way to optimise images and speed up their loading times on websites. By utilizing Imagify’s AVIF and WebP optimizer, you can efficiently convert images to these next-gen formats, saving you a precious amount of time.</p>\n<p>With Imagify, WebP conversion and compression are indeed super easy. Wondering how the convert WebP option works? Imagify will automatically enable WebP and convert your images to WebP. You can also easily convert WebP images to AVIF.</p>\n<p>If the &#8220;Create Next-gen formats versions&#8221; option is enabled, the AVIF version of optimized images will be created automatically. Simple as that! Thanks to the best WebP and AVIF plugin for WordPress, you’ll be able to take advantage of the automatic convert WebP feature in no time, plus you’ll always have the convert AVIF option.</p>\n<p>Imagify can also display the AVIF images directly on your front-end. But because some browser versions don’t support AVIF yet, Imagify lets you have both optimized versions of the original format images and the WebP versions ready. Imagify will serve the AVIF version if a visitor&#8217;s browser supports it and the WebP format if not (if you have previously converted the images to WebP).</p>\n<p>WebP is definitively an excellent replacement for jpeg, png, and gif images, and the same goes for AVIF, which improves your image performance even further. Imagify offers WebP conversion for all image formats: you can convert gif to WebP, jpeg to WebP, and even png to WebP. You can also benefit from AVIF conversion and convert gif to AVIF, jpg and jpeg to AVIF, png to AVIF, and even WebP to AVIF!<br />\nWhatever your favorite image format, let Imagify optimise your images!</p>\n<h4>Optimise Images to Make Your Site Faster and Improve Core Web Vitals</h4>\n<p>Did you know that image optimization and web performance go hand in hand? In fact, when it comes to web page speed, one of the first things you should do is optimize your images. Large and heavy image sizes will indeed slow down your website and provide a bad user experience to your visitors – and that’s why you should compress images. On the contrary, when you optimise images and improve image loading speed, you should see a direct improvement in your website speed and performance. With Imagify, it’s time to say goodbye to images taking too long to load.</p>\n<p>Images are one of the largest influencing factors in the Core Web Vitals. Image compression will ensure your images load faster and improve your overall website performance, including your Core Web Vitals metrics. If you’re looking to improve user experience and speed up your WordPress site, images are a good place to start.</p>\n<p>Even Google tells you to take care of your images! If you have ever run a performance audit on PageSpeed Insights, you might have seen the <a href=\"https://imagify.io/blog/serve-next-gen-formats-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">“serve images in next-gen formats”</a> opportunity popping up. Another PageSpeed Insights recommendation related to images is to <a href=\"https://imagify.io/blog/efficiently-encode-images-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">“efficiently encode images”</a>. When you use Imagify, you will be able to address both recommendations and fix your images for a faster website.</p>\n<h4>What Do Our Users Think Of Imagify?</h4>\n<p>Here’s what our users have to say about us after optimizing their images with Imagify:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Images and other media are the largest parts on your web pages (most likely).

Your plugin made it easy for me to do.<br />\n  Conbrio75 &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We also built the ability to save your code snippets to <a href=\"https://library.wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPCode Cloud Library</a>, so you can easily re-use it on your other websites, client projects, or even share it with the larger community.</p>\n<p>WPCode Cloud Library helps you better organize your code snippets in one central location, so you can save more time and speed up your workflow when managing websites. No more wasting time looking for custom notes or Github gists.</p>\n<p>Aside from our growing code snippets library, we also have WordPress code generators to help you quickly get ready-to-use custom code using the latest WordPress coding standards and API&#8217;s.</p>\n<h4>Conditional Logic for Code Snippets + Code Insertion Priority</h4>\n<p>Our goal with WPCode was to create a WordPress code snippets plugin that&#8217;s both EASY and POWERFUL.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why aside from our global header and footer scripts, we added advanced features like conditional logic for code snippets and made it easy.</p>\n<p>Instead of learning WordPress conditional logic queries, you can use our beginner-friendly conditional logic user interface to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Load code snippets for logged in users only</li>\n<li>Load PHP code snippets for specific user roles</li>\n<li>Load PHP code snippets only on specific page URLs</li>\n<li>Insert header and footer pixel scripts on specific pages</li>\n<li>Show code snippets based on type of page</li>\n<li>Run code snippet only on certain post types</li>\n<li>Load header and footer code snippet based on referrer source</li>\n<li>and more&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also added both automatic code insertion and manual code output using shortcodes.</p>\n<p>Our Auto Insert feature allows you to run the code snippet everywhere or choose from custom options like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run code snippet only on frontend</li>\n<li>Run code snippet only in WordPress admin area</li>\n<li>Add header and footer scripts sitewide</li>\n<li>Insert PHP code snippet before or after post content</li>\n<li>Insert code snippet before or after specific paragraph</li>\n<li>Insert code snippet on specific archive pages</li>\n<li>Insert code snippets after specific WooCommerce function (<a href=\"https://wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro Feature</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aside from that, we also added a visual code snippet priority system, so you can choose the order for your custom functions to avoid code conflict.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is such a useful plugin! It makes it so much easier to include things on your website!<br />\n  Understoryliving &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And for even more flexibility and customization, we have added the ability for you to add page-specific code snippets right from the WordPress classic editor as well as the Gutenberg editor. You can even load code snippets based on device type such as mobile only code snippets, desktop only code snippets, etc.</p>\n<h4>Import and Export Code Snippets</h4>\n<p>Managing multiple websites or developing in a staging environment?</p>\n<p>We offer an easy way to import and export your custom code snippets, functions, and header and footer scripts to help you save time.</p>\n<p>You can also save your code snippets to WPCode Cloud (Pro feature), so you can easily re-use the same code snippets across multiple websites. This also allows you to better organize your code snippets instead of wasting time searching for random Github gists.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Simple plugin I use in quite every site. Very useful to insert scripts and tags.<br />\n  tommasoperego &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Full WPCode Feature List</h4>\n<p>The simple interface of WPCode plugin (formerly known as Insert Headers and Footers) gives you one place where you can insert header and footer scripts as well as custom code snippets rather than dealing with dozens of different plugins.</p>\n<p>Below is a full list of WPCode features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick to set up</li>\n<li>Unlimited code snippets</li>\n<li>Simple to insert header and footer scripts globally</li>\n<li>Beginner Friendly Code Editor with Syntax Highlighter for PHP, JavaScript, and HTML</li>\n<li>Smart Code Validation to Prevent PHP Errors</li>\n<li>Insert header code and/or footer code using Conditional Logic</li>\n<li>Add <strong>Google Analytics</strong> code to header and footer</li>\n<li>Add <strong>custom CSS</strong> code to any theme</li>\n<li>Insert <strong>Facebook pixel</strong> code in header and footer</li>\n<li>Insert any code or script, including HTML and Javascript</li>\n<li>Insert PHP Code Snippets</li>\n<li>Ready-made Code Snippet Library</li>\n<li>Custom WordPress Code Snippet Generator</li>\n<li>Show or Hide PHP Code Snippets based on conditional logic</li>\n<li>Run PHP code and custom code snippets everywhere or in select areas using smart auto-insert rules.</li>\n<li>Manually insert PHP code snippets using shortcodes anywhere on website</li>\n<li>Add Rich Text Ads and Content Snippets automatically on posts &amp; pages.</li>\n<li>Export / Import Code Snippets</li>\n<li><strong>New</strong> Save snippets to Cloud Library &#8211; All your snippets stored in your private code snippet cloud.</li>\n<li><strong>New</strong> Deep integrations with Gutenberg, WooCommerce, and more.</li>\n<li>Device specific code snippets (such as load code snippets on mobile only, desktop only, etc)</li>\n<li>and more features coming soon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Credits</h4>\n<p>Insert Headers and Footers plugin was first created by <a href=\"https://syedbalkhi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Syed Balkhi</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPBeginner</a> team in 2011.</p>\n<p>It was later rebranded to WPCode in 2022 by Syed Balkhi to add powerful code snippets features that users were requesting for.</p>\n<h4>Branding Guideline</h4>\n<p>WPCode™ is a trademark of WPCode LLC.

Experts and leaders of major businesses are quickly recognizing the role that generative ai will play in the future of search. Millions of people every day ask artificial intelligence for recommendations, common facts, and how-to knowledge. This trend will continue to grow exponentially in the years to come. However, their are inherent limitations on what AI can and can’t do. It is very good at recalling information, and wording even very complex topics in a way that even a layman can understand. But, it does not possess the specialist knowledge that many online content creators and businesses put into the content they post on their website, nor does it know anything about the things that are going on at that business.</p>\n<p>That is where ContentOracle AI Chat comes in. ContentOracle AI Chat bridges the gap between the unique insights your organization offers in your blog content and the power of AI to clearly and concisely get site visitors the information they are looking for. What results is a user experience that doesn’t give vistors a generic answer, but rather an answer uniquely tailored based on your content. Add to this the fact that our AI can recommend relevant posts, products, events, and more based on a goal you set, semantic content anaysis, and a suite of analytic features, and you’ve got a game-changing addition to your user&#8217;s experience on your website.</p>\n<p>Note: this plugin requires you to make a ContentOracle AI Chat account in order to make the plugin work.  More details below&#8230;</p>\n<h3>3rd-Party Services</h3>\n<p>This app makes use of the ContentOracle AI api to process user messages, index website content, and generate chat responses.  The url of the api is: https://app.contentoracleai.com.  Here is the url of it&#8217;s terms of service: https://app.contentoracleai.com/terms.  Data sent to the api includes messages the user enters into chat blocks, content from the website (posts, pages, products, etc.), server and client domains and ips (to prevent abuse), and analytic data to enhance the performance of the application.  Messages and site content may be stored and indexed for debugging and feature development purposes. ContentOracle AI is an api that is used on a pay-as-you-go basis by enrolled sites.  The API is required to make the blocks supplied by this plugin work, and allows site visitors to use an ai chat feature to interact witht he information in your content in a more intuitive and lively way.</p>\n<h3>3rd-Party Libraries</h3>\n<p>This plugin makes use of the following third-party libraries and services:<br />\n&#8211; AlpineJS: a small javascript library for introducing reactive data to the ui. https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine<br />\n&#8211; Floating UI: a small javascript library that handles dynamically creating and positioning tooltips. https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui<br />\n&#8211; PHP NLP Tools: a php library for natural language processing, used to help find the most relevant content to a message. https://github.com/angeloskath/php-nlp-tools<br />\n&#8211; Marked: a javascript library for parsing markdown strings to html.<br />\n&#8211; DOMPurify: a javascript, DOM only HTML XSS sanitizer.</p>\n",

    "short_description": "Extends the WP REST API using JSON Web Tokens Authentication as an authentication method.",
    "description": "<p>Extends the WP REST API using JSON Web Tokens Authentication as an authentication method.</p>\n<p>JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">RFC 7519</a> method for representing claims securely between two parties.</p>\n<p><strong>Support and Requests please in Github:</strong> https://github.com/Tmeister/wp-api-jwt-auth</p>\n<h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>\n<h4>WP REST API V2</h4>\n<p>This plugin was conceived to extend the <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP REST API V2</a> plugin features and, of course, was built on top of it.</p>\n<p>So, to use the <strong>wp-api-jwt-auth</strong> you need to install and activate <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP REST API</a>.</p>\n<h3>PHP</h3>\n<p><strong>Minimum PHP version: 7.4.0</strong></p>\n<h3>PHP HTTP Authorization Header enable</h3>\n<p>Most of the shared hosting has disabled the <strong>HTTP Authorization Header</strong> by default.</p>\n<p>To enable this option you&#8217;ll need to edit your <strong>.htaccess</strong> file adding the follow</p>\n<pre><code>RewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)\nRewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]\n</code></pre>\n<h4>WPENGINE</h4>\n<p>To enable this option you&#8217;ll need to edit your <strong>.htaccess</strong> file adding the follow</p>\n<p>See https://github.com/Tmeister/wp-api-jwt-auth/issues/1</p>\n<pre><code>SetEnvIf Authorization \"(.*)\" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1\n</code></pre>\n<h3>CONFIGURATION</h3>\n<h3>Configurate the Secret Key</h3>\n<p>The JWT needs a <strong>secret key</strong> to sign the token this <strong>secret key</strong> must be unique and never revealed.</p>\n<p>To add the <strong>secret key</strong> edit your wp-config.php file and add a new constant called <strong>JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY</strong></p>\n<pre><code>define('JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY', 'your-top-secret-key');\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can use a string from here https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/</p>\n<h3>Configurate CORs Support</h3>\n<p>The <strong>wp-api-jwt-auth</strong> plugin has the option to activate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CORs</a> support.</p>\n<p>To enable the CORs Support edit your wp-config.php file and add a new constant called <strong>JWT_AUTH_CORS_ENABLE</strong></p>\n<pre><code>define('JWT_AUTH_CORS_ENABLE', true);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally activate the plugin within your wp-admin.</p>\n<h3>Namespace and Endpoints</h3>\n<p>When the plugin is activated, a new namespace is added</p>\n<pre><code>/jwt-auth/v1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also, two new endpoints are added to this namespace</p>\n<p>Endpoint | HTTP Verb<br />\n<em>/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token</em> | POST<br />\n<em>/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token/validate</em> | POST</p>\n<h3>USAGE</h3>\n<h3>/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token</h3>\n<p>This is the entry point for the JWT Authentication.</p>\n<p>Validates the user credentials, <em>username</em> and <em>password</em>, and returns a token to use in a future request to the API if the authentication is correct or error if the authentication fails.</p>\n<h4>Sample request using AngularJS</h4>\n<pre><code>( function() {\n\n  var app = angular.module( 'jwtAuth', [] );\n\n  app.controller( 'MainController', function( $scope, $http ) {\n\n    var apiHost = 'http://yourdomain.com/wp-json';\n\n    $http.post( apiHost + '/jwt-auth/v1/token', {\n        username: 'admin',\n        password: 'password'\n      } )\n\n      .then( function( response ) {\n        console.log( response.data )\n      } )\n\n      .catch( function( error ) {\n        console.error( 'Error', error.data[0] );\n      } );\n\n  } );\n\n} )();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Success response from the server</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOlwvXC9qd3QuZGV2IiwiaWF0IjoxNDM4NTcxMDUwLCJuYmYiOjE0Mzg1NzEwNTAsImV4cCI6MTQzOTE3NTg1MCwiZGF0YSI6eyJ1c2VyIjp7ImlkIjoiMSJ9fX0.YNe6AyWW4B7ZwfFE5wJ0O6qQ8QFcYizimDmBy6hCH_8\",\n    \"user_display_name\": \"admin\",\n    \"user_email\": \"admin@localhost.dev\",\n    \"user_nicename\": \"admin\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Error response from the server</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"code\": \"jwt_auth_failed\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"status\": 403\n    },\n    \"message\": \"Invalid Credentials.\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you get the token, you must store it somewhere in your application, ex. in a <strong>cookie</strong> or using <strong>localstorage</strong>.</p>\n<p>From this point, you should pass this token to every API call</p>\n<p>Sample call using the Authorization header using AngularJS</p>\n<pre><code>app.config( function( $httpProvider ) {\n  $httpProvider.interceptors.push( [ '$q', '$location', '$cookies', function( $q, $location, $cookies ) {\n    return {\n      'request': function( config ) {\n        config.headers = config.headers || {};\n        //Assume that you store the token in a cookie.\n        var globals = $cookies.getObject( 'globals' ) || {};\n        //If the cookie has the CurrentUser and the token\n        //add the Authorization header in each request\n        if ( globals.currentUser &amp;&amp; globals.currentUser.token ) {\n          config.headers.Authorization = 'Bearer ' + globals.currentUser.token;\n        }\n        return config;\n      }\n    };\n  } ] );\n} );\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <strong>wp-api-jwt-auth</strong> will intercept every call to the server and will look for the Authorization Header, if the Authorization header is present will try to decode the token and will set the user according with the data stored in it.</p>\n<p>If the token is valid, the API call flow will continue as always.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample Headers</strong></p>\n<pre><code>POST /resource HTTP/1.1\nHost: server.example.com\nAuthorization: Bearer mF_s9.B5f-4.1JqM\n</code></pre>\n<h3>ERRORS</h3>\n<p>If the token is invalid an error will be returned, here are some samples of errors.</p>\n<p><strong>Invalid Credentials</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[\n  {\n    \"code\": \"jwt_auth_failed\",\n    \"message\": \"Invalid Credentials.\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"status\": 403\n    }\n  }\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Invalid Signature</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[\n  {\n    \"code\": \"jwt_auth_invalid_token\",\n    \"message\": \"Signature verification failed\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"status\": 403\n    }\n  }\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Expired Token</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[\n  {\n    \"code\": \"jwt_auth_invalid_token\",\n    \"message\": \"Expired token\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"status\": 403\n    }\n  }\n]\n</code></pre>\n<h3>/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token/validate</h3>\n<p>This is a simple helper endpoint to validate a token; you only will need to make a POST request sending the Authorization header.</p>\n<p>Valid Token Response</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  \"code\": \"jwt_auth_valid_token\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"status\": 200\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>AVAILABLE HOOKS</h3>\n<p>The <strong>wp-api-jwt-auth</strong> is dev friendly and has five filters available to override the default settings.</p>\n<h4>jwt_auth_cors_allow_headers</h4>\n<p>The <strong>jwt_auth_cors_allow_headers</strong> allows you to modify the available headers when the CORs support is enabled.</p>\n<p>Default Value:</p>\n<pre><code>'Access-Control-Allow-Headers, Content-Type, Authorization'\n</code></pre>\n<h3>jwt_auth_not_before</h3>\n<p>The <strong>jwt_auth_not_before</strong> allows you to change the <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.5\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>nbf</strong></a> value before the token is created.</p>\n<p>Default Value:</p>\n<pre><code>Creation time - time()\n</code></pre>\n<h3>jwt_auth_expire</h3>\n<p>The <strong>jwt_auth_expire</strong> allows you to change the value <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4\" rel=\"nofollow

<strong>jwt_auth_token_before_sign</strong> allows you to modify all the token data before to be encoded and signed.</p>\n<p>Default Value</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n$token = array(\n    'iss' =&gt; get_bloginfo('url'),\n    'iat' =&gt; $issuedAt,\n    'nbf' =&gt; $notBefore,\n    'exp' =&gt; $expire,\n    'data' =&gt; array(\n        'user' =&gt; array(\n            'id' =&gt; $user-&gt;data-&gt;ID,\n        )\n    )\n);\n</code></pre>\n<h3>jwt_auth_token_before_dispatch</h3>\n<p>The <strong>jwt_auth_token_before_dispatch</strong> allows you to modify all the response array before to dispatch it to the client.</p>\n<p>Default Value:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n$data = array(\n    'token' =&gt; $token,\n    'user_email' =&gt; $user-&gt;data-&gt;user_email,\n    'user_nicename' =&gt; $user-&gt;data-&gt;user_nicename,\n    'user_display_name' =&gt; $user-&gt;data-&gt;display_name,\n);\n</code></pre>\n<h3>jwt_auth_algorithm</h3>\n<p>The <strong>jwt_auth_algorithm</strong> allows you to modify the signing algorithm.</p>\n<p>Default value:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n$token = JWT::encode(\n    apply_filters('jwt_auth_token_before_sign',

The pages are stored locally on the system where LiteSpeed server software is installed and are not transferred to or accessed by LiteSpeed employees in any way, except as necessary in providing routine technical support if you request it. All cache files are temporary, and may easily be purged before their natural expiration, if necessary, via a Purge All command. It is up to individual site administrators to come up with their own cache expiration rules.</p>\n<p>In addition to caching, our WordPress plugin has online features provided by QUIC.cloud for Image Optimization, CSS Optimization and Low Quality Image Placeholder services. When one of those optimizations are requested, data is transmitted to a remote QUIC.cloud server, processed, and then transmitted back for use on your site. Now if using the QUIC.cloud CDN it uses LSCache technologies to access your site then host your site to others globally and also your data is not transferred to or accessed by QUIC.cloud employees in any way, except as necessary in providing maintenance or technical support. QUIC.cloud keeps copies of that data for up to 7 days and then permanently deletes them. Similarly, the WordPress plugin has a Reporting feature whereby a site owner can transmit an environment report to LiteSpeed so that we may better provide technical support. None of these features collects any visitor data. Only server and site data are involved.</p>\n<p>Please see the <a href=\"https://quic.cloud/privacy-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">QUIC.cloud Privacy Policy</a> for our complete Privacy/GDPR statement.</p>\n",

With loginizer you can change it to anything e.g. site-admin</li>\n<li>CSRF Protection &#8211; This helps in preventing CSRF attacks as it updates the admin URL with a session string which makes it difficult and nearly impossible for the attacker to predict the URL.</li>\n<li>Rename Login with Secrecy &#8211; If set, then all Login URL&#8217;s will still point to wp-login.php and users will have to access the New Login Slug by typing it in the browser.</li>\n<li>Disable XML-RPC &#8211; An option to simply disable XML-RPC in WordPress. Most of the WordPress users don&#8217;t need XML-RPC and can disable it to prevent automated brute force attacks.</li>\n<li>Rename XML-RPC &#8211; The Admin can rename the XML-RPC to something different from xmlrpc.php to prevent automated brute force attacks.</li>\n<li>Username Auto Blacklist &#8211; Attackers generally use common usernames like admin, administrator, or variations of your domain name / business name. You can specify such username here and Loginizer will auto-blacklist the IP Address(s) of clients who try to use such username(s).</li>\n<li>New Registration Domain Blacklist &#8211; If you would like to ban new registrations from a particular domain, you can use this utility to do so.</li>\n<li>Change the Admin Username &#8211; The Admin can rename the admin username to something more difficult.</li>\n<li>Auto Blacklist IPs &#8211; IPs will be auto blacklisted, if certain usernames saved by the Admin are used to login by malicious bots / users.</li>\n<li>Disable Pingbacks &#8211; Simple way to disable PingBacks.</li>\n<li>SSO &#8211; Single Sign-on, let any user access to your WordPress Dashboard without the need to share username or password.</li>\n<li>Limit Concurrent Logins &#8211; It prevents user to login from different devices concurrently, you can define how many devices you want to allow, and how you want to restrict the user when concurrent limit is reached.</li>\n<li>Social Login &#8211; Users can login or register with their Google, Github, Facebook, X (Twitter), Discord, Twitch, LinkedIn with support for WooCommerce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Features in Loginizer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blocks IP after maximum retries allowed</li>\n<li>Extended Lockout after maximum lockouts allowed</li>\n<li>Email notification to admin after max lockouts</li>\n<li>Blacklist IP/IP range</li>\n<li>Whitelist IP/IP range</li>\n<li>Check logs of failed attempts</li>\n<li>Create IP ranges</li>\n<li>Delete IP ranges</li>\n<li>Licensed under LGPLv2.1</li>\n<li>Safe &amp; Secure</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description": "<p>Manager for Cloudflare Zaraz provides a simple interface to control Cloudflare Zaraz functionality on your WordPress website, allowing you to easily enable/disable Zaraz and configure its behavior for different user types. While the plugin requires manual configuration of the Zaraz script (detailed instructions available in the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cloudflare Zaraz documentation</a>), this approach offers significant advantages for WordPress users focused on maintaining clean analytics data.</p>\n<p>By default, Cloudflare&#8217;s automatic Zaraz injection loads on all pages &#8211; including wp-admin &#8211; and tracks all users regardless of their login status. This can lead to skewed analytics data and unnecessary performance overhead. Our plugin addresses these limitations by giving you precise control over Zaraz&#8217;s loading behavior. Through manual configuration and our intuitive interface, you can ensure Zaraz only loads where and when you want it to, automatically excluding internal traffic from administrators and logged-in users. This results in more accurate visitor insights while preserving all the powerful third-party script management capabilities that make Zaraz valuable.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable/disable Zaraz functionality</li>\n<li>Option to disable Zaraz for logged-in users</li>\n<li>Clean and intuitive settings interface</li>\n<li>Lightweight and optimized performance</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 5.0 or higher</li>\n<li>PHP 7.3.5 or higher</li>\n<li>A Cloudflare account with Zaraz enabled</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Languages Available</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>🇺🇸 English (Default)</li>\n<li>🇮🇹 Italian (it_IT)</li>\n<li>🇫🇷 French (fr_FR)</li>\n<li>🇩🇪 German (de_DE)</li>\n<li>🇳🇱 Dutch (nl_NL)</li>\n<li>🇷🇺 Russian (ru_RU)</li>\n<li>🇪🇸 Spanish (es_ES)</li>\n<li>🇯🇵 Japanese (ja_JP)</li>\n<li>🇮🇳 Hindi (hi_IN)</li>\n<li>📝 POT file available for translations</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Additional Information</h3>\n<p>For more information about Cloudflare Zaraz, please visit the <a href=\"https://zaraz.io/docs/getting-started/installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Zaraz documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin is not affiliated with or endorsed by Cloudflare.</p>\n",

I&#8217;ve designed Microthemer for developers as well as beginners. My aim is to level up beginners by exposing the CSS code Microthemer generates when using the visual controls. This is of course helpful for developers who may wish to make manual edits. Some developers use Microthemer as an in-browser CSS or Sass editor, and just lean on the interface for element selection or more advanced properties like filters, grid, and animation.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been happily developing Microthemer and supporting users of varying technical experience in my forum for many years now. I&#8217;m always ready to answer questions about the software and help out with CSS hurdles. Please don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch!</p>\n",

    "description": "<h4>STOP BOT AND HACKER ATTACKS</h4>\n<p>Safeguard your website’s forms and login areas from misuse, spam, and data theft caused by both bots AND hackers. POWER CAPTCHA uses customizable parameters to verify whether access is legitimate, either granting or denying access based on your chosen criteria.</p>\n<h4>MORE THAN JUST BOT PROTECTION</h4>\n<p>While many captchas only focus on stopping bots, they often fail to guard against unauthorized access by real users, such as someone repeatedly trying to guess login credentials or submitting forms multiple times. POWER CAPTCHA goes beyond traditional bot detection by evaluating all interactions, regardless of whether they&#8217;re human or automated. It uses flexible criteria — e.g. usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and/or login attempts within specific timeframes — to assess if access is genuinely authorized.</p>\n<p>Each interaction generates an encrypted code, or &#8220;client footprint,&#8221; which POWER CAPTCHA stores and analyzes. For future attempts, it can, for example, increase the challenge level or temporarily block further actions. With customizable settings based on your license, POWER CAPTCHA adapts to your specific security needs. You can also configure it as a no-captcha option.</p>\n<h4>GDPR-COMPLIANT, ACCESSIBLE, AND BUILT IN GERMANY</h4>\n<p>POWER CAPTCHA is cookie-free, GDPR-compliant, and easy to integrate with most systems. For added security and accessibility, the Enterprise Plan includes features like two-factor authentication.</p>\n<h4>Supported Plugins and Forms</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WordPress</strong> Login </li>\n<li><strong>WordPress</strong> Registration </li>\n<li><strong>WordPress</strong> Lost Password </li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce</strong> Login</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce</strong> Registration</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce</strong> Lost Password</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce</strong> Checkout</li>\n<li><strong>WPForms</strong></li>\n<li><strong>WPForms lite</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Elementor Pro Forms</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Contact Form 7</strong></li>\n</ul>\n",

They turn on their webcams and hang out in public (presale) rooms  waiting for members to chat.  Performers are listed on a page (live performers show first) and site visitors can join them.</p>\n<p>Paying clients can invite performers to do private video chat shows and pay per minute. They first need to register as clients and add some money to their virtual wallet on site to be able to request private shows.</p>\n<p>Payments go from clients to site owner’s account depending on billing gateway (multiple supported).  Site owner can see earnings for each performer and send payments as necessary.</p>\n<h4>Billing</h4>\n<p>Clients can prepay credits that can be used for ppv chat. Billing is supported with TeraWallet (WooCommerce Wallet) and/or myCRED plugin that includes PayPal Standard, Skrill (Moneybookers), NETbilling, Zombaio, BitPay (bitcoin).  Other payment modules are available for extra: 2checkout, ComproPago, CoinBase, CoinPayments, PayFast, Payza, Robokassa, Stripe, WePay.<br />\nWooWallet supports free and premium payment gateways: PayPal (Standard, Checkout), Stripe (CC, Apple Pay, Google Pay, SEPA, Bancontact, Sofort, Giropay, EPS, iDeal, Przelewy24, Alipay, Multibanco),  Square (CC U.S, Canada, Australia, Japan and the UK), Amazon Pay, PayFast, Venmo, eWay (SG, MY, HK, AU, NZ), Klarna (now, later, slice), Authorize.Net, SagePay (UK), WorldPay, 2 Checkout.</p>\n<p>Payouts can be made manually by site owner, with the Payout Tool that generates mass CSV payout lists (for processors like Paypal, Skrill) or with 3rd party plugins/addons.</p>\n<h3>Demos</h3>\n<p>WordPress turnkey site demos on:<br />\n* <a href=\"https://paidvideochat.com/demo/\" title=\"PaidVideochat Turnkey Site Demo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PaidVideochat Turnkey Site Demo</a><br />\n* <a href=\"https://demo.fanspaysite.com\" title=\"FansPaySite Demo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FansPaySite Demo</a></p>\n<p>Simplified demonstrative setups for testing videochat app without registration:<br />\n* <a href=\"https://demo.videowhisper.com/videocall-html5-videochat-php/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Video Call PHP / HTML5 Videochat on Wowza SE</a><br />\n* <a href=\"https://demo.videowhisper.com/p2p-html5-videocall/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Video Call PHP / HTML5 Videochat on VideoWhisper WebRTC</a><br />\n* <a href=\"https://demo.videowhisper.com/html5-videochat-php/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Live Streaming PHP / HTML5 Videochat on Wowza SE</a><br />\n* <a href=\"https://demo.videowhisper.com/vws-html5-livestreaming/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Live Streaming PHP / HTML5 Videochat on VideoWhisper WebRTC</a><br />\n* <a href=\"https://demo.videowhisper.com/cam-recorder-html5-video-audio/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cam/Mic Recorder HTML5 &#8211; Standalone</a><br />\n* <a href=\"https://2wayvideochat.com/random-videochat/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Random Videochat</a></p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Redirection is the most popular redirect manager for WordPress. With it you can easily manage 301 redirections, keep track of 404 errors, and generally tidy up any loose ends your site may have. This can help reduce errors and improve your site ranking.</p>\n<p>Redirection is designed to be used on sites with a few redirects to sites with thousands of redirects.</p>\n<p>It has been a WordPress plugin for over 10 years and has been recommended countless times. And it&#8217;s free!</p>\n<p>Full documentation can be found at <a href=\"https://redirection.me\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://redirection.me</a></p>\n<p>Redirection is compatible with PHP from 7.0 to 8.3.</p>\n<h4>Redirect manager</h4>\n<p>Create and manage redirects quickly and easily without needing Apache or Nginx knowledge. If your WordPress supports permalinks then you can use Redirection to redirect any URL.</p>\n<p>There is full support for regular expressions so you can create redirect patterns to match any number of URLs. You can match query parameters and even pass them through to the target URL.</p>\n<p>The plugin can also be configured to monitor when post or page permalinks are changed and automatically create a redirect to the new URL.</p>\n<h4>Conditional redirects</h4>\n<p>In addition to straightforward URL matching you can redirect based on other conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Login status &#8211; redirect only if the user is logged in or logged out</li>\n<li>WordPress capability &#8211; redirect if the user is able to perform a certain capability</li>\n<li>Browser &#8211; redirect if the user is using a certain browser</li>\n<li>Referrer &#8211; redirect if the user visited the link from another page</li>\n<li>Cookies &#8211; redirect if a particular cookie is set</li>\n<li>HTTP headers &#8211; redirect based on a HTTP header</li>\n<li>Custom filter &#8211; redirect based on your own WordPress filter</li>\n<li>IP address &#8211; redirect if the client IP address matches</li>\n<li>Server &#8211; redirect another domain if also hosted on this server</li>\n<li>Page type &#8211; redirect if the current page is a 404</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Full logging</h4>\n<p>A configurable logging option allows to view all redirects occurring on your site, including information about the visitor, the browser used, and the referrer. A &#8216;hit&#8217; count is maintained for each redirect so you can see if a URL is being used.</p>\n<p>Logs can be exported for external viewing, and can be searched and filtered for more detailed investigation.</p>\n<p>Display geographic information about an IP address, as well as a full user agent information, to try and understand who the visitor is.</p>\n<p>You are able to disable or reduce IP collection to meet the legal requirements of your geographic region, and can change the amount of information captured from the bare minimum to HTTP headers.</p>\n<p>You can also log any redirect happening on your site, including those performed outside of Redirection.</p>\n<h4>Add HTTP headers</h4>\n<p>HTTP headers can be added to redirects or your entire site that help reduce the impact of redirects or help increase security. You can also add your own custom headers.</p>\n<h4>Track 404 errors</h4>\n<p>Redirection will keep track of all 404 errors that occur on your site, allowing you to track down and fix problems.</p>\n<p>Errors can be grouped to show where you should focus your attention, and can be redirected in bulk.</p>\n<h4>Query parameter handling</h4>\n<p>You can match query parameters exactly, ignore them, and even pass them through to your target.</p>\n<h4>Migrate Permalinks</h4>\n<p>Changed your permalink structure? You can migrate old permalinks simply by entering the old permalink structure. Multiple migrations are supported.</p>\n<h4>Apache &amp; Nginx support</h4>\n<p>By default Redirection will manage all redirects using WordPress. However you can configure it so redirects are automatically saved to a .htaccess file and handled by Apache itself.</p>\n<p>If you use Nginx then you can export redirects to an Nginx rewrite rules file.</p>\n<h4>Fine-grained permissions</h4>\n<p>Fine-grained permissions are available so you can customise the plugin for different users. This makes it particularly suitable for client sites where you may want to prevent certain actions, and remove functionality.</p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export</h4>\n<p>The plugin has a fully-featured import and export system and you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Import and export to Apache .htaccess</li>\n<li>Export to Nginx rewrite rules</li>\n<li>Copy redirects between sites using JSON</li>\n<li>Import and export to CSV for viewing in a spreadsheet</li>\n<li>Use WP CLI to automate import and export</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also import from the following plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple 301 Redirects</li>\n<li>SEO Redirection</li>\n<li>Safe Redirect Manager</li>\n<li>Rank Math</li>\n<li>WordPress old slug redirects</li>\n<li>Quick Post/Pages redirects</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Search Regex compatible</h4>\n<p>Redirection is compatible with <a href=\"https://searchregex.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Search Regex</a>, allowing you to bulk update your redirects.</p>\n<h4>Wait, it&#8217;s free?</h4>\n<p>Yes, it&#8217;s really free. There&#8217;s no premium version and no need to pay money to get access to features. This is a dedicated redirect management plugin.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>Please submit bugs, patches, and feature requests to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/johngodley/redirection\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/johngodley/redirection</a></p>\n<p>Please submit translations to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/redirection\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/redirection</a></p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Regenerate Thumbnails allows you to regenerate all thumbnail sizes for one or more images that have been uploaded to your Media Library.</p>\n<p>This is useful for situations such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new thumbnail size has been added and you want past uploads to have a thumbnail in that size.</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve changed the dimensions of an existing thumbnail size, for example via Settings â Media.</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve switched to a new WordPress theme that uses featured images of a different size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It also offers the ability to delete old, unused thumbnails in order to free up server space.</p>\n<h4>In Memory of Alex Mills</h4>\n<p>In February 2019 Alex Mills, the author of this plugin, <a href=\"https://alex.blog/2019/02/27/from-alexs-family/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">passed away</a>. He leaves behind a number of plugins which will be maintained by Automattic and members of the WordPress community. If this plugin is useful to you please consider donating to the Oregon Health and Science University. You can find more information <a href=\"https://alex.blog/2019/03/13/in-memory-of-alex-donation-link-update/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p><strong>WP-CLI</strong></p>\n<p>If you have command line access to your server, I highly recommend using <a href=\"https://wp-cli.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP-CLI</a> instead of this plugin as it&#8217;s faster (no HTTP requests overhead) and can be run inside of a <code>screen</code> for those with many thumbnails. For details, see the documentation of its <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/media/regenerate/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>media regenerate</code> command</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Jetpack&#8217;s Photon Module</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Jetpack</a> is a plugin by Automattic, makers of WordPress.com. It gives your self-hosted WordPress site some of the functionality that is available to WordPress.com-hosted sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/photon/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The Photon module</a> makes the images on your site be served from WordPress.com&#8217;s global content delivery network (CDN) which should speed up the loading of images. Importantly though it can create thumbnails on the fly which means you&#8217;ll never need to use this plugin.</p>\n<p>I personally use Photon on my own website.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for Automattic but I would recommend Photon even if I didn&#8217;t.</em></p>\n<h4>Need Help? Found A Bug? Want To Contribute Code?</h4>\n<p>Support for this plugin is provided via the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/regenerate-thumbnails\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress.org forums</a>.</p>\n<p>The source code for this plugin is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/regenerate-thumbnails\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n",

    "short_description": "Helps website owners automate and add versatile schema markup to their websites, enabling more informative and visually appealing search results.",
    "description": "<p>The main purpose of the Schema Package is to automate the creation of schema markup (JSON-LD) for websites. Schema markup acts as structured data that helps Search Engines and other platforms better understand website content. Instead of manually entering the same information twice — once in the actual content and again in the Schema Package Generator metabox or other custom fields. Schema Package simplifies the process. It achieves this by integrating with plugins or themes that generate content, ensuring compatibility and automation.</p>\n<p>We have automated the creation of schema markup (JSON-LD) for some of the plugins listed below. If your plugin is not on the list, please <a href=\"https://github.com/amanstacker/schema-package/issues/new\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">request</a> or contact us, and we will automate it as well.</p>\n<p>If you still want to enter schema markup manually, We have provided the Schema Package Generator. It’s a powerful, minimal design, popup-like structure that allows you to smoothly fill in the data for all schema types, one by one.</p>\n<h3>Your Trust, Our Motive: Exceptional Schema Markup Services</h3>\n<p>As newcomers to the market, earning your trust can be challenging. We invite you to give us a try, and we&#8217;ll go above and beyond to ensure your satisfaction with setting up schema markup for your site. Don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to us for any assistance.</p>\n<h3>What is Schema Markup and why is it important?</h3>\n<p>Schema Markup refers to the standardized vocabulary (provided by Schema.org) used to structure data in a format that Search Engines or AI Systems can understand. JSON-LD is one way to implement Schema Markup; others include Microdata and RDFa. By providing additional context about your content, schema markup can help Search Engines present more relevant and detailed results to users, benefiting both the website&#8217;s visibility and user interaction.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Search Engine Visibility</strong> &#8211; By adding schema markup to a webpage, Search Engines and AI Systems can better understand its content. This often leads to rich snippets, which can appear in search results, such as star ratings, prices, images, and other structured data. These elements increase the visibility of the webpage in search results.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced AI Systems Results</strong> &#8211; AI can easily parse structured data to understand the key attributes of the content, making it more accurate when providing answers or generating summaries.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Click-Through Rate (CTR)</strong> &#8211; Rich snippets stand out more in search results, leading to higher engagement and more clicks. For example, when a recipe shows cooking times and ratings in the search results, users may be more likely to click.</li>\n<li><strong>Better User Experience</strong> &#8211; Schema markup helps Search Engines and AI Systems present content in a more relevant and accessible way. For example, when an article includes structured data, users can find key details like publication date, author, and main topic more easily.</li>\n<li><strong>Voice Search Optimization</strong> &#8211; Schema markup can help optimize content for voice search, where structured data allows devices like virtual assistants to understand and retrieve the information more efficiently, improving voice search rankings.</li>\n<li><strong>Local SEO Improvement</strong> &#8211; For businesses with a physical presence, schema markup can improve local SEO by providing location-based data (e.g., business hours, contact information, and address) that helps your business show up in local search results.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Indexing</strong> &#8211; Search Engines can better interpret and index your content when schema markup is in place, which can help get your pages indexed faster and more accurately.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What is JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data)?</h3>\n<p>JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format that uses JSON to encode structured data. It is one of the formats recommended by all popular Search Engines for adding schema markup ( structured data ) to web pages. JSON-LD embeds data in the  tags of an HTML document without affecting the visual appearance of the page.</p>\n<h3>Schema Package Key Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unlimited Schema</strong>: No limitation on schema type selection, Add as much as you want.</li>\n<li><strong>Singular Schema</strong>: Select different kinds of schema based on your needs globally.</li>\n<li><strong>Singular Targeting</strong>: Target your selected Singular schema types based on your needs, such as posts, pages, custom post types, taxonomies, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Carousel Schema</strong>: Choose various schema types according to your requirements and automate them for detailed JSON-LD views.</li>\n<li><strong>Carousel Targeting</strong>: Target your selected Carousel schema types based on your needs, such as categories, tags, Product categories, taxonomies, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Schema Package Generator</strong>: Select different kinds of schema based on your needs.</li>\n<li><strong>JSON-LD Format</strong>: Schema Package only supports JSON-LD Format as recommended by most of the Search Engines.

It does not guarantee that your content will appear in search engine results as you desire. It entirely depends on the Search Engines.</p>\n<p>Here are some schema and structured data markup validator tools that can help you validate and troubleshoot your markup:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://search.google.com/test/rich-results\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Rich Results Test</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The &#8220;Google Rich Results Test&#8221; does not validate all types of schema.org markup. It is primarily designed to test the types of schema markup that can generate rich results in Google search, such as Product, Recipe, Event, FAQ and others related to search features.</p>\n<p>While it can validate whether your structured data is correctly implemented for rich results, it doesn&#8217;t support every schema.org type. For example, it may not check more general types like Service, Organization, or CreativeWork, unless they are directly relevant to a rich result display.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://validator.schema.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Schema Markup Validator</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The &#8220;Schema Markup Validator&#8221; by Google validates all schema.org types, not just those that are eligible for rich results. This tool checks whether your structured data is correctly implemented according to the schema.org specifications, regardless of whether the type is eligible for rich results.</p>\n<h3>Report Bug or Contribute fix</h3>\n<p>Encounter an issue with Schema Package? or wanted to contribute. Kindly visit Schema Package repository on <a href=\"https://github.com/amanstacker/schema-package\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>. Please be aware that GitHub is not a support forum, but rather a streamlined platform for effectively addressing and solving problems.</p>\n<h3>Support Center</h3>\n<p>We currently don&#8217;t have an official website for the Schema Package, but you can reach out to us through the Schema Package dashboard.</p>\n<p>Go To &#8211; Schema Package -&gt; Settings -&gt; Help &amp; Support.</p>\n<h3>WordPress REST API</h3>\n<p>The Schema Package uses the WordPress REST API to power its single-page application dashboard. If you’re unable to access the Schema Package dashboard, it’s likely that your site is blocking the REST API, or another plugin has restricted access. Please ensure the WordPress REST API is enabled for the Schema Package to function properly.</p>\n<h3>External Services</h3>\n<p>Schema Package uses the following external services:</p>\n<h4>1.

It provides detailed information on how to optimize each aspect of your site and maximizes your website performance and cache.</p>\n<h3>CACHING</h3>\n<p>The Caching page gives you full control of your website’s cache, allowing you to enhance its performance significantly. Take advantage of the powerful caching options available to boost your page speed:</p>\n<h4>DYNAMIC CACHING:</h4>\n<p>By enabling Dynamic Caching, all non-static resources of your website are intelligently cached, eliminating the need for repetitive database queries and enhancing page loading speed and TTFB (time to first byte). This default feature is available exclusively for SiteGround servers, ensuring optimal performance.</p>\n<h4>FILE-BASED CACHING:</h4>\n<p>By activating file-based caching, your website generates and stores static HTML versions, ensuring faster loading times and an improved user experience. This efficient caching method stores the cached files conveniently in the browser&#8217;s memory, allowing future visitors to access your site swiftly and seamlessly.</p>\n<h4>MEMCACHED:</h4>\n<p>Unleash the power of object caching for your WordPress website. Memcached revolutionizes website performance by storing frequently executed queries to your databases and reusing them for lightning-fast website results. This powerful feature is exclusively available in the SiteGround environment.</p>\n<h4>CACHING SETTINGS:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automatic Cache Purge:</strong> ensure the cache is cleared whenever necessary</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Cache Purge:</strong> purge cache manually if you are editing new material and do not have automatic purge activated.</li>\n<li><strong>Browser-specific Caching:</strong> generate caching separately for different browsers</li>\n<li><strong>Exclude Post Types from Caching:</strong> exclude specific post types from being cached</li>\n<li><strong>Exclude URLs from Caching:</strong> exclude specific URLs or utilize wildcards to exclude any sub-pages of a designated &#8220;parent-page.&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Test URL Caching Status:</strong> verify if dynamic caching is actively running on specific URLs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>ENVIRONMENT OPTIMIZATIONS</h3>\n<p>Optimize and fine-tune your site&#8217;s environment for optimal website performance:</p>\n<h4>HTTPS Enforce:</h4>\n<p>Ensure a secure browsing experience for your visitors by effortlessly enabling HTTPS for your site. Say goodbye to insecure content errors and build trust with your audience.</p>\n<h4>Scheduled Database Maintenance:</h4>\n<p>Take control of your database by activating the Database Optimization feature. This functionality removes unnecessary items and optimizes your database tables, leading to improved efficiency and website performance. If you&#8217;re using the InnoDB storage engine, table optimisation is automatically handled by the engine itself.</p>\n<h4>Heartbeat Control:</h4>\n<p>Manage the frequency of the WP Heartbeat for different areas of your website. By default, the WordPress Heartbeat API checks for scheduled tasks every 15 seconds on post edit pages and every 60 seconds on the dashboard and front end. With Heartbeat Control, you can adjust the frequency of these checks or even disable them entirely, providing you with greater control over resource allocation.</p>\n<h3>FRONTEND OPTIMIZATIONS</h3>\n<p>Enhance and fine-tune the performance of your website&#8217;s front end by minifying JS, HTML and CSS:</p>\n<h4>CSS Tab:</h4>\n<p>Minify CSS files, activate or deactivate CSS combinations to reduce server requests, and even preload combined CSS for optimized performance. Additionally, you can exclude specific styles from being combined or minified, giving you complete control over your CSS optimization.</p>\n<h4>JavaScript Tab:</h4>\n<p>Activate or deactivate Minify JavaScript Files to reduce script sizes and lower the number of server requests. You can also defer render-blocking JavaScript to expedite the initial page speed. Furthermore, you have the ability to exclude specific scripts from various optimisation processes, providing flexibility in optimizing your JavaScript resources.</p>\n<h4>General Tab:</h4>\n<p>Further optimization options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Web Fonts Optimization:</strong> Enhance the loading of Google fonts by adding a preconnect link in your head tag. This informs the browser to establish a connection to Google&#8217;s font repository as quickly as possible. Additionally, all other local fonts will be preloaded, resulting in faster caching and rendering. When combined with CSS Combination, we also modify the font-display property to improve rendering speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Fonts Preloading:</strong> With locally hosted fonts being preloaded, you’re allowing browsers to cache and render them at an accelerated pace.</li>\n<li><strong>Remove Query Strings from Static Resources:</strong> Improve caching efficiency by removing query strings from static resources, optimizing their caching capabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Disable Emojis:</strong> Prevent WordPress from detecting and generating emojis on your pages by disabling emojis support. This helps boost your page speed and improve your website performance.</li>\n<li><strong>DNS Pre-fetch for External Domains:</strong> Enabling the DNS Pre-fetch for a domain will resolve it before resources from it get requested making those resources load faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>MEDIA OPTIMIZATIONS</h3>\n<p>Optimize your website media by reducing image size by up to 85% times while maintaining top-notch quality.</p>\n<h4>Image Compression:</h4>\n<p>Effortlessly compress images to resize your existing images and reduce the space they occupy on your server. The dimensions of the images will remain unchanged, allowing for optimized storage. Fine-tune the compression level and choose whether to create backups of the original images. Please note that image compression feature is exclusive to the SiteGround Environment.</p>\n<h4>WebP Images:</h4>\n<p>Leverage the power of WebP, a cutting-edge image format supported by modern browsers, to significantly reduce the size of your images and skyrocket your page speed. If a browser doesn&#8217;t support WebP, the original images will be loaded.</p>\n<h4>Lazy Load Media:</h4>\n<p>Take control of your website&#8217;s asset loading with the ability to enable or disable Lazy Load for various assets. You can exclude specific assets such as iframes, videos, thumbnails, widgets, and shortcodes from the dropdown menu. Additionally, you have the option to exclude specific images from the Lazy Load by adding their respective class in the dedicated tab.</p>\n<h4>Maximum Image Width:</h4>\n<p>If you frequently upload large images to your website, you can enable the Maximum Image Width option that automatically resizes existing and future images whose width exceeds 2560 pixels. By optimizing image sizes, you can enhance your website performance and reduce bandwidth usage.<br />\nYou can customize your media optimisation to your specific needs using the filters, we’ve designed for this purpose.</p>\n<h3>SPEED TEST</h3>\n<p>Evaluate the optimization level of your website with Speed Optimizer’s Speed test tool. Our website performance check utilizes the robust capabilities of Google PageSpeed to provide comprehensive insights into your site&#8217;s optimization. By conducting the speed test, you will receive detailed results highlighting areas that can be further optimized for enhanced performance. These insights will empower you to fine-tune your website and unlock its maximum potential and increase conversions.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p>In order to work correctly, this plugin requires that your server meets the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.7</li>\n<li>PHP 7.0+</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our plugin uses a cookie in order to function properly. It does not store personal data and is used solely for the needs of our caching system.</p>\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\n<p>Collection of technical data is optional and is <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/kb/what-information-wp-plugins-collect\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">listed here</a>. This data is collected only for technical analysis, improvements and the possibility to contact the plugin user in case urgent issues need to be fixed (for example a critical security release that needs to be communicated to site owners). The plugin user can manage their preferences within the WP admin to control the collection of technical data. We advise opting in for this data collection, as it can enhance the plugin&#8217;s performance. You may find more information on data collection in our <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/viewtos/siteground_plugins_privacy_notice\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugins Privacy Notice</a>.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p>Photo credits to Anna Shvets https://www.pexels.com/@shvetsa</p>\n",

Our comprehensive features are specifically designed to strengthen your website&#8217;s defenses against malware, exploits, and various malicious activities. With these tools at your disposal, you can ensure the utmost bot, malware and brute force protection for your website:</p>\n<h4>Lock and Protect System Folders</h4>\n<p>Ensure the maximum security for your application&#8217;s system folders by preventing the execution of any unauthorized or malicious scripts. The Lock and Protect System Folders feature acts as a powerful shield against potential threats.</p>\n<h4>Hide WordPress Version</h4>\n<p>Protect your website from mass attacks by hiding the WordPress version, which helps to mitigate version-specific vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h4>Disable Themes &amp; Plugins Editor</h4>\n<p>Enhance the security of your WordPress admin area by disabling the Themes &amp; Plugins Editor, preventing potential coding errors and unauthorized access through the editor.</p>\n<h4>Disable XML-RPC</h4>\n<p>Mitigate potential security risks by disabling the XML-RPC protocol, which has been exploited in various attacks. Please note that disabling XML-RPC will restrict WordPress from communicating with third-party systems. We recommend enabling this feature unless you have a specific need for it.</p>\n<h4>Disable RSS and ATOM Feeds</h4>\n<p>Prevent content scraping and specific attacks on your site by disabling RSS and ATOM feeds. Unless you have readers accessing your site via RSS readers, it is recommended to keep this feature enabled.</p>\n<h4>Advanced XSS Protection</h4>\n<p>Add an extra layer of website security against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by enabling Advanced XSS Protection, bolstering the overall security of your website.</p>\n<h4>Delete Default Readme.html</h4>\n<p>Eliminate potential vulnerabilities by deleting the default readme.txt file, which contains information about your website. By removing this file, you reduce the risk of your site being listed in vulnerable sites targeted by hackers.</p>\n<h3>Login Security</h3>\n<h4>Custom Login Url</h4>\n<p>Personalize your login URL to thwart potential attacks and create a strong entry point. Bid farewell to the default login URL and embrace a bespoke path of your choosing. Additionally, you have the freedom to modify the default sign-up URL as well.</p>\n<h4>Login Access</h4>\n<p>Restrict login page access to specific IP addresses or IP ranges, effectively thwarting malicious login attempts and deterring brute force attacks.</p>\n<h4>2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)</h4>\n<p>Immerse your website in an impenetrable shield of security with 2FA. This formidable feature demands that all admin users furnish a unique token, generated exclusively through the Google Authentication application, during the login process.</p>\n<h4>Disable Common Usernames</h4>\n<p>Don&#8217;t fall victim to predictable security breaches! The use of common usernames, such as &#8216;admin,&#8217; poses a significant threat to the integrity of your website. Activate this option to disable the creation of common usernames. If any weak usernames already exist, we&#8217;ll prompt you to provide new, stronger alternatives.</p>\n<h4>Limit Login Attempts</h4>\n<p>Maintain control over unauthorized access attempts with Limit Login Attempts. Set a specific threshold for the number of login failures users can endure before consequences arise. After reaching the limit, the IP address associated with the unsuccessful login attempts will be blocked for one hour. Persistent failures will result in longer restrictions, starting with 24 hours and escalating to a week.</p>\n<h3>ACTIVITY MONITORING</h3>\n<p>Monitor your website and login page for unauthorized visitors and brute force attempts to prevent malicious actions</p>\n<h4>Activity Log</h4>\n<p>The Activity Log page provides you with a comprehensive view of the activities performed by registered, unknown, and blocked visitors. It allows you to closely monitor any suspicious behavior and take appropriate actions in case of a compromised user, plugin, or hacking attempt. You can leverage the quick tools available to swiftly block future attempts.</p>\n<h4>Weekly Security Reports</h4>\n<p>Receive a weekly traffic summary for your website directly to your inbox. This <strong>Weekly Security Report</strong> compiles data on both bot and human traffic, along with details about blocked login and visit attempts to proactively monitor traffic and promptly identify suspicious activity.</p>\n<h3>POST-HACK ACTIONS</h3>\n<p>Take immediate measures to protect your website if you suspect a compromise and prevent further damage. Here, you&#8217;ll find convenient solutions to address the situation effectively:</p>\n<h4>Reinstall All Free Plugins</h4>\n<p>In the event of a hack, utilizing the Reinstall All Free Plugins feature can help mitigate potential harm. This action reinstalls all of your free plugins, reducing the likelihood of additional exploits or the reuse of malicious code.</p>\n<h4>Log Out All Users</h4>\n<p>To prevent any further unauthorized activities by users or attackers, you can choose to log out all users instantly using the Log Out All Users feature.</p>\n<h4>Force Password Reset</h4>\n<p>By enforcing a password reset, you can ensure that all users are prompted to change their passwords during their next login. This not only strengthens the security of their accounts but also immediately logs out all currently logged-in users.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.7</li>\n<li>PHP 7.0</li>\n<li>Working .htaccess file</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\n<p>Collection of technical data is optional and is <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/kb/what-information-wp-plugins-collect\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">listed here</a>. This data is collected only for technical analysis, improvements and the possibility to contact the plugin user in case urgent issues need to be fixed (for example a critical security release that needs to be communicated to site owners). The plugin user can manage their preferences within the WP admin to control the collection of technical data. We advise opting in for this data collection, as it can enhance the plugin&#8217;s performance.

    "description": "<p>Introducing the i-rent.net Accommodation Rental Plugin for WordPress!</p>\n<p>Exclusively designed for i-rent.net clients, this plugin seamlessly integrates with your WordPress website to showcase and manage accommodations. With a user-friendly booking system powered by the i-rent.net property management platform, you can provide a hassle-free experience for your guests.</p>\n<p>This WordPress plugin integrates the simple rental booking system from i-rent.net into a selected page on the user’s website.</p>\n<p>The plugin establishes a secure connection to the authentication API at “https://api.auth.i-rent.net/apps/authenticate”. This connection enables the user to gain access to the Property Management System (PMS). Upon successful authentication, the user is provided with a script from “https://scriptvjs.i-rent.net/js/app.js”. This script forms the bridge between the user’s WordPress page and the i-rent.net system.</p>\n<p>The authentication process is a crucial security measure designed to protect both the usage of the plugin and the integrity of the data. It ensures that only authorized users can access the PMS and interact with the data therein. This way, the security and privacy of the system and the data it manages are maintained.</p>\n<p>In addition to the authentication process, the plugin also fetch a list of accommodations for the agent using the following API call: &#8220;https://api.i-rent.net/v1/plugin/locations&#8221;. This API returns a list of available locations associated with the agent.</p>\n<p>The script utilizes Vue.js technology and Material Design principles to construct the user interface that will be inserted into the user’s webpage. This combination allows for a dynamic, responsive, and visually appealing interface that enhances the user experience.</p>\n<p>In essence, this process ensures a seamless integration of the script into the user’s webpage, while preserving the aesthetic and functional aspects of both the script and the webpage. It’s a meticulous design choice aimed at delivering an optimal and consistent user experience.</p>\n<p>Use of a Third-Party Service<br />\nThis plugin relies on a third-party service, i-rent.net, to provide its functionality. Specifically, it connects to two services from i-rent.net:<br />\n    1 &#8211; i-rent.net Authentication API: This API is used to authenticate the user into the Property Management System (PMS). The URL for the API is “https://api.auth.i-rent.net/apps/authenticate”.<br />\n    2 &#8211; i-rent.net Locations API: This API is used to get a list of available locations associated with the agent. The URL for the API is &#8220;https://api.i-rent.net/v1/plugin/locations&#8221;.<br />\n    3 &#8211; i-rent.net Script: This script provides the user interface that gets inserted into the user’s webpage. The URL for the script is “https://scriptvjs.i-rent.net/js/app.js”.<br />\n    4 &#8211; Litepicker: A lightweight and responsive date-picker library used for date selection in the booking interface. More information: Litepicker Documentation &#8220;https://litepicker.com/&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information about these services, including their terms of use and privacy policies (https://www.i-rent.net/privacy-policy-and-terms-conditions/), please visit i-rent.net.

Become the expert in your niche and provide the contacts and information that searchers really need!<br />\nIn return, you will be rewarded with better rankings in the search engines by perfectly serving the search intent of your visitors.</p>\n<p>The best thing: You can earn money with the plugin!<br />\nYou can either specify whether an entry in a particular category is displayed in 1st place, highlighted in color. Or you can add your own affiliate links to entries 🙂</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s also cool is that you can simply import data. Use the &#8216;WP All Import&#8217; plugin for this.</p>\n<h3>How to use it</h3>\n<p>Once you have installed the plugin, you can select “Addresses” from the side menu. Here you can create new address entries, create categories and assign the address entries to the categories.</p>\n<p>In the settings, you can decide whether the entries should only be displayed as a list or whether a detailed view of the address entry should also be generated. Initially, no detailed view is generated. You can also decide this later.</p>\n<p>You can also specify what the slug of the address entries should be. This is a decision on how the URL structure of your business directory should be set up.</p>\n<p>Create a new subpage, e.g. /industry/, and integrate the listing block. This listing block contains a free search field and a selection field for the categories.<br />\nUsers can thus search for addresses freely across all entries or restrict them by category selection and thus only search within the selected category.</p>\n<p>The results are displayed immediately.</p>\n<p><em>Ideally, the name of the subpage and the slug defined in the plugin settings should be identical!</em><br />\nThe URL is structured according to the category in which the addresses are located. E.G.<br />\nurl.com/industry/category/SingleView</p>\n<p>To get the most out of your listings, you should use our WPSC plugin to output the address data in a structured JSON-LD format.</p>\n<h3>Updates</h3>\n<p>We will continuously develop new elements and deliver them as updates.</p>\n<h3>Sponsoring</h3>\n<p>If you want a special gutenberg block, we can implement it especially for your needs. As a sponsor you will be mentioned on the website, the plugin description and the changelog. If you are interested, write us an e-mail <em>infoⒶwpsc-plugin.com</em></p>\n",

    "short_description": "Safely upload SVGs to the Media Library, sanitize/minify them, and even render them inline for direct styling/animation of internal elements.",
    "description": "<p><strong>Upload SVG files to your media library securely, with built-in sanitization and advanced features for styling and animation.</strong></p>\n<p>SVG Support goes beyond just enabling SVG uploads. It offers powerful features that make working with SVGs easier and more flexible.</p>\n<p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are a staple in modern web design, allowing you to embed images with small file sizes that scale perfectly at any size without losing quality. However, styling and animating SVGs can be challenging when using standard methods. SVG Support simplifies this by allowing you to render your SVGs inline, enabling direct styling and animation using CSS and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>This plugin provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SVG Upload Support</strong>: Easily upload SVG files to your media library.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic Sanitization</strong>: All SVG uploads are sanitized by default to ensure security.</li>\n<li><strong>Minification Options</strong>: Reduce SVG file sizes with optional minification.</li>\n<li><strong>Inline Rendering</strong>: Render SVG code inline by adding the <code>\"style-svg\"</code> class to your images, making the elements within your SVGs directly targetable for styling and animation.</li>\n<li><strong>Role-Based Upload Control</strong>: Restrict SVG upload capabilities to specific user roles.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom Target Class</strong>: Define a custom CSS class for targeting SVGs, which can be applied to outer elements for greater flexibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Full SVG support in your media library</li>\n<li>Automatic sanitization for secure SVG uploads</li>\n<li>Optional minification for smaller SVG file sizes</li>\n<li>Role-based upload restrictions</li>\n<li>Inline SVG rendering for easy styling and animation</li>\n<li>Custom target class support for flexible SVG handling</li>\n<li>Simple and intuitive settings page with clear instructions</li>\n<li><strong>Extremely Simple to Use &#8211; Simplifies complex SVG file handling</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Installation</strong>: Install and activate SVG Support (this plugin) through your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Basic Usage</strong>: Once activated, you can upload SVG files to your media library like any other image file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Admin Settings</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigate to &#8220;Settings &gt; SVG Support&#8221; in your WordPress admin dashboard.</li>\n<li>Restrict SVG file uploads to specific user roles, such as Administrators.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Advanced Mode</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you only need to upload SVG files as static images, you don’t need to enable &#8220;Advanced Mode&#8221;. This keeps the plugin lightweight by not enqueuing unnecessary scripts.</li>\n<li><strong>For Advanced Use</strong>: Enable &#8220;Advanced Mode&#8221; to access additional features such as minification and inline rendering.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inline SVG Rendering</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With Advanced Mode enabled, you can embed SVG images by adding the <code>\"style-svg\"</code> class (or a custom class you’ve defined) to your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags.</li>\n<li>Example:<br />\n<code>&lt;img class=\"style-svg\" alt=\"alt-text\" src=\"image-source.svg\" /&gt;</code><br />\nor<br />\n<code>&lt;img class=\"your-custom-class\" alt=\"alt-text\" src=\"image-source.svg\" /&gt;</code></li>\n<li>The plugin dynamically replaces the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element with the actual SVG code, making the SVG’s internal elements targetable by CSS and JavaScript.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Custom Target Classes</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can set a custom class to target for inline rendering.</li>\n<li>You can add the target class to outer elements if you cannot directly add it to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. The plugin will traverse the element’s children to find and replace the SVG.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Auto-Class Insertion (Classic Editor)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable the setting to automatically add your target class to SVG images when inserting them into posts or pages. This also removes unnecessary attributes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inline Rendering</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since version 2.3.11, you can force all SVG files sitewide to be rendered inline with a single checkbox (use with caution).</li>\n<li>You can choose between the minified or expanded version of the JS file for inline rendering.</li>\n<li>You can choose between the jQuery or vanilla JS file for inline rendering.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Featured Images</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you save a post/page with an SVG as the featured image, a checkbox will appear in the featured image meta box to allow you to render the SVG inline (only available if Advanced Mode is active).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: If your SVG isn’t displaying correctly, it might be due to 0 height and width. Set your SVG’s dimensions in your CSS to ensure proper display.</p>\n<p><em>For any issues, please use the support tab, and I will do my best to assist you quickly.</em></p>\n<h3>Spin up a test site</h3>\n<p>With a single click, you can spin up a completely free test site to test SVG Support using TasteWP!

SVG Support provides several features to help mitigate these risks and ensure secure handling of SVG files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sanitization by default: Starting from version 2.5.8, all SVG uploads are sanitized by default to remove any potentially malicious code.</li>\n<li>Role-Based Upload Restrictions: You can restrict SVG uploads to specific user roles, ensuring only trusted users can upload these files.</li>\n<li>Optional Bypass of Sanitization: You have the option to allow certain roles to bypass the sanitization process, though this should be used with caution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important: Only allow users you trust to upload SVG files.

This is a great advantage of working with a plugin like Team Showcase.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>IMPORTANT: If you think you found a bug in Team Showcase or have any problem or question concerning Team Showcase and Slider plugin, do not hesitate to contact us at www.wpmart.org/contact-us</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Features Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Display Team member in grid view.</li>\n<li>Display Team member in slider view.</li>\n<li>Team member name font color, font size, line height, font hover color, &amp; family.</li>\n<li>Team member Designation font color, font size, line height, font hover color, &amp; family.</li>\n<li>Team member Social links font color &amp; size.</li>\n<li>Team member Social links font Hover color.</li>\n<li>Customize the margin</li>\n<li>Unlimited Colors</li>\n<li>Fully Responsive</li>\n<li>30+ Different layout with 50+ exclusive design</li>\n<li>Drag &amp; Drop ordering</li>\n<li>Unlimited Shortcode</li>\n<li>User-friendly Interface</li>\n<li>Touch-enable feature</li>\n<li>Unlimited different styles of member thumbnails.</li>\n<li>Fully and very easily customizable look by admin panel.</li>\n<li>The plugin made with an accent on simplicity, and it is easy to use.</li>\n<li>Front-end browsing</li>\n<li>Sleek, clean and modern design.</li>\n<li>Manual responsive</li>\n<li>Grid with Margin or No Margin.</li>\n<li>Social icon, color size, and background color control.</li>\n<li>Social links (FB, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ etc)</li>\n<li>Output your team members anywhere with the shortcode [wpm_team_showcase]</li>\n<li>Easy to setup</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tags:team, team members plugin, team members slider plugin, our team, wordpress team member, team members, team showcase, team slider, Meet My Team, stuff, our stuff, meet the stuff, команда, о компании, о нас, персонал, работники, профиль работника, участник команды, член команды, виджет команды, team grid, staff grid, employees, workers, people, cv, staff bio, member staff</p>\n",

It lets you to continue to use the familiar TinyMCE editor for most tasks, and at the same time gives you full access to all blocks and new features in the block editor.</p>\n<p>Version 5.5 continues to improve and enhance the new features introduced in version 5.0 of the plugin. It includes an improved &#8220;Clear Formatting&#8221; button, several advanced settings for tables, and importing and exporting of the settings to a file.</p>\n<p>If you want to continue to use the previous (&#8220;classic&#8221;) editor in WordPress 5.0 and newer, this plugin has an option to replace the new editor with the previous one. If you prefer to have access to both editors side by side or to allow your users to switch editors, it would be better to install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"ugc\">Classic Editor plugin</a>. Advanced Editor Tools is fully compatible with the classic editor plugin and similar plugins that restore use of the previous WordPress editor.</p>\n<p>As always this plugin will let you add, remove and arrange the buttons that are shown on the Visual Editor toolbar in the Classic Paragraph and Classic blocks in the block editor, and in the classic editor (when enabled by a plugin). There you can configure up to four rows of buttons including Font Sizes, Font Family, text and background colors, tables, etc.</p>\n<p>It includes 15 plugins for <a href=\"https://www.tiny.cloud/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TinyMCE</a> that are automatically enabled or disabled depending on the buttons you have chosen.<br />\nIn addition this plugin adds options for keeping the paragraph tags in text mode and importing the CSS classes from the theme&#8217;s editor-style.css.</p>\n<h4>Some of the features added by this plugin</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Classic Paragraph&#8221; block that can be used instead of or together with the standard Paragraph block.</li>\n<li>An option to set the Classic Paragraph or Classic block as the default block in the block editor.</li>\n<li>Supports converting of most default blocks to classic paragraphs, and from classic paragraphs back to the default blocks.</li>\n<li>Support for creating and editing tables in the Classic blocks and the classic editor.</li>\n<li>More options when inserting lists in the Classic blocks and the classic editor.</li>\n<li>Search and Replace in the Classic blocks and the classic editor.</li>\n<li>Ability to set Font Family and Font Sizes in the Classic blocks and the classic editor.</li>\n<li>And many others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Privacy</h4>\n<p>Advanced Editor Tools does not collect or store any user related data. It does not set cookies, and it does not connect to any third-party websites.

    "description": "<p>User-friendly approach to Facebook Conversion API tracking and Google Server-side Tagging for improved event sending, by-passing 3rd party cookie limitations. Eliminate setup frustrations and gain accurate, reliable data to drive smarter advertising decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br />\n&#8211; Simple and intuitive setup process<br />\n&#8211; Clean reliable interface<br />\n&#8211; Testing logs to verify events being sent<br />\n&#8211; Handles &#8220;click&#8221; triggers and &#8220;shown&#8221; triggers</p>\n<p><strong>Why Choose UniPixel?</strong><br />\nUniPixel provides a hassle-free experience, ensuring peace of mind with reliable performance. With clear guidance and robust features, you can confidently track conversions and manage events using the Facebook Conversion API, making your advertising efforts more effective.</p>\n<h3>Privacy and 3rd Party Services</h3>\n<p>This plugin relies on external services provided by Meta (Facebook) and Google to track and log user events for analytics and advertising purposes. The plugin interacts with the following services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meta (Facebook) Pixel</strong>: Sends user event data (e.g., PageView, Purchase) to Facebook for tracking purposes.</li>\n<li><strong>Meta&#8217;s Graph API</strong>: Sends user event data server-side for tracking and logging purposes.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Analytics</strong>: Sends user event data to Google for analytics and tracking via the Measurement Protocol and Google Tag Manager.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Domains</h3>\n<p>This plugin communicates with the following domains:<br />\n&#8211; <strong>Meta (Facebook)</strong>:<br />\n  &#8211; https://www.facebook.com<br />\n  &#8211; https://graph.facebook.com<br />\n&#8211; <strong>Google</strong>:<br />\n  &#8211; https://www.google-analytics.com<br />\n  &#8211; https://www.googletagmanager.com</p>\n<h3>Data Sent</h3>\n<p>Data sent to Meta (Facebook) and Google may include:<br />\n&#8211; User interactions (e.g., clicks, page views, purchases)<br />\n&#8211; IP address and user agent (collected by tracking mechanisms)<br />\n&#8211; Custom event data such as purchase amount, currency, and transaction ID (depending on how the plugin is configured)</p>\n<h3>Privacy and Terms</h3>\n<p>For more details on Meta&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s privacy policies and terms of use, please visit the following links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Meta (Facebook) Privacy Policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terms.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Meta (Facebook) Terms of Service</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://policies.google.com/terms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Terms of Service</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tips</h3>\n<h4>Deduplication</h4>\n<p>To ensure events tracked by both the Facebook Pixel and the Conversion API are not counted twice, use deduplication. This involves sending an event ID with each event tracked by the pixel and the API. Facebook uses this ID to identify and merge identical events, providing accurate tracking and reporting. Configure this in your Facebook Business Manager settings under Events Manager.</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>This plugin is licensed under the GPLv2 or later.</p>\n",

    "short_description": "Duplicate any existing widget using the Widget Alias widget and shortcode.",
    "description": "<p><strong>Compatible with PHP 8.2</strong></p>\n<p>Widget Alias allows you to create an &#8220;alias&#8221; of any existing widget, effectively reproducing / duplicating it. This can be especially handy when you want the same widget to appear in multiple sidebars. Normally you would have to edit each widget independently, but Widget Alias means you&#8217;ll only have to edit one.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://mightyminnow.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>MIGHTYminnow</strong></a> plugin.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<p>This plugin is similar to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-widget\" rel=\"ugc\">Duplicate Widget</a>, with a few key differences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Widget Alias gives you the option to override the aliased widget&#8217;s title.</li>\n<li>Widget Alias uses AJAX to update the drop-down <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> menus on the fly, which means you see widget changes (adding widgets, deleting widgets, re-ordering widgets, etc) in real time.</li>\n<li>If you delete a widget that is being aliased, the aliased copies simply revert to &#8220;None&#8221;, instead of being deleted. This allows you to keep track of where you&#8217;ve used Widget Alias widgets, if need be.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<p>Widget Alias can be used in one of two ways:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Widget</strong><br />\nIn <em>Appearances &gt; Widgets</em> you&#8217;ll see a new widget called &#8220;Widget Alias&#8221;, in which you can specify an override title if desired, and use the drop-down <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> menu to choose the ID of the widget you would like to alias.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Shortcode</strong><br />\nWidget Alias also comes packaged with a shortcode that looks like this:<br />\n    [widget_alias id=&#8221;target-widget-id&#8221; title=&#8221;Override Title&#8221;]</p>\n<p>To use the shortcode simply enter the ID of the widget you would like to alias (<code>id</code> parameter), and an override title (<code>title</code> parameter) if you would like to change the aliased widget&#8217;s title.</p>\n<h4>Widget IDs</h4>\n<p>Widget Alias makes it super-easy for you to find the ID of any widget you would like to alias. In <em>Appearance &gt; Widgets</em>, all active widgets now have their ID appended below the widget title. Note: these IDs are added using jQuery, and will not appear if JavaScript is disabled.</p>\n<h4>Removing / Deleting Aliased Widgets</h4>\n<p>Widget Alias makes it easy to tell which widgets are being aliased &#8211; each aliased widget has a note below its widget controls letting you know how many times it is aliased. If you delete an aliased widget, the Widget Alias widgets that previously pointed to it will revert to the default alias value of &#8220;None.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Banner photo by <a href=\"http://susannahkay.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Susannah Kay</a>.</p>\n",

Az Opciók gombbal felül lehet írni a beállításokban megadott értékeket 1-1 számlához.<br />\nHa az automata számlakészítés be van kapcsolva, akkor automatikusan létrehozza a számlát a rendszer a rendelés állapotának változásakor.<br />\nA számlakészítés kikapcsolható 1-1 rendelésnél az Opciók legördülőn belül.<br />\nAz elkészült számla a rendelés aloldalán és a rendelés listában az utolsó oszlopban található PDF ikonra kattintva letölthető.</p>\n<p><strong>FONTOS:</strong> Mindenen esetben ellenőrizd le, hogy a számlakészítés megfelelő e és konzultálj a könyvelőddel, neki is megfelelnek e a generált számlák. Sajnos minden esetet nem tudok tesztelni, különböző áfakulcsok, termékvariációk, kuponok stb&#8230;, így mindenképp teszteld le éles használat előtt és ha valami gond van, jelezd felém és megpróbálom javítani.</p>\n<h4>Fejlesztőknek</h4>\n<p>A plugin a Billingo API-n keresztül küldi be az adatokat és készíti el a számlát. Az API hívás előtt módosítható a <code>wc_billingo_plus_partner</code> és a <code>wc_billingo_plus_invoice</code> filterrel. Ez minden esetben az éppen aktív téma functions.php fájlban történjen, hogy az esetleges plugin frissítés ne törölje ki a módosításokat!

    "description": "<h3>WordPress Mail SMTP Plugin</h3>\n<p>Is your WordPress site not sending emails? You&#8217;re not alone. 3+ million websites use WP Mail SMTP to send emails reliably.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to make email deliverability easy so that your emails always reach the inbox.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP fixes your email deliverability issues by reconfiguring WordPress to use a proper SMTP provider when sending emails.</p>\n<p>Best of all, our easy-to-use Setup Wizard and detailed documentation guide you through the process.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP is free and has everything you need to reliably send your WordPress emails!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>WP Mail SMTP Pro</strong></a> unlocks even more powerful features like email logging, advanced email reporting and stats, backup connections, email alerts, smart conditional routing, and much more.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WP Mail SMTP Overview\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYJuPyiKKZc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h4>What is SMTP?</h4>\n<p>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry-standard for sending emails. Proper SMTP configuration helps increase email deliverability by adding authentication to the emails sent from your site.</p>\n<p>Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, Office 365, and Zoho are in a constant battle with email spammers, so they check whether emails are originating from a genuine sender. If the proper authentication isn&#8217;t there, emails either go in the SPAM folder or, worse, disappear.</p>\n<p>This is a problem for a lot of WordPress sites. By default, WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact form plugin like <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/?utm_source=wprepo-wpmailsmtp&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPForms</a>.</p>\n<p>But most <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress hosting companies</a> don&#8217;t have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.</p>\n<p>This is why WordPress emails aren’t delivered.</p>\n<h4>How does WP Mail SMTP work?</h4>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin easily resolves email delivery problems by changing the way your WordPress site sends email. We reconfigure the <code>wp_mail()</code> function to use proper SMTP host credentials or an SMTP mail provider.</p>\n<p>With our built-in SMTP mail provider integrations (recommended), emails are sent using the provider&#8217;s direct API. Even if your web host is blocking SMTP ports, your emails will still be sent successfully.</p>\n<p>This helps you fix all <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/wordpress-not-sending-email/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress not sending email</a> issues.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin includes many different SMTP mailers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>SendLayer <strong>(#1 Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>SMTP.com <strong>(Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) SMTP <strong>(Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>Gmail SMTP (Gmail, Google Workspace, G Suite)</li>\n<li>Elastic Email</li>\n<li>Mailgun SMTP</li>\n<li>Mailjet SMTP</li>\n<li>SendGrid SMTP</li>\n<li>Postmark SMTP</li>\n<li>SparkPost SMTP</li>\n<li>SMTP2GO</li>\n<li>Microsoft SMTP One-Click Setup (Outlook.com and Office 365) <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Amazon SES SMTP <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Zoho Mail SMTP <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Other SMTP</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For most options, you can specify the &#8220;from name&#8221; and &#8220;email address&#8221; for outgoing emails too.</p>\n<p>All of these powerful features make WP Mail SMTP the best SMTP solution for WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know which mailer to choose, see our <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/docs/a-complete-guide-to-wp-mail-smtp-mailers/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Complete Guide to WP Mail SMTP Mailers</a>.</p>\n<h4>SendLayer</h4>\n<p>SendLayer is our #1 recommended transactional email service.</p>\n<p>Its affordable pricing and simple setup make it the perfect choice for sending emails from WordPress.

It&#8217;s a <strong>comprehensive set of tools</strong> to help you manage your website&#8217;s memory. For example, hardware memory, PHP memory, and WordPress memory limits.It confirms that your <strong>hosting is indeed delivering the promised hardware memory size</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But it goes further: it alerts you when memory is dangerously low, especially if it&#8217;s already depleted. It also keeps a log of how much memory each page has occupied, as different pages use varying amounts of memory. Additionally, it logs errors from your server. While WordPress only notifies you of fatal errors, it doesn&#8217;t alert you to other issues that can also impact your site&#8217;s performance, making it slower or hindering navigation, and preventing users from seeing things correctly.</p>\n<p>Premium Version: Say goodbye to complex coding and the risk of accidental file changes. WP Memory Check allows you to effortlessly <strong>fix both the PHP Memory Limit and the WordPress Memory Limit</strong> without the need for intricate coding modifications or the fear of unintended file alterations.</p>\n<p>Take action and install the WPmemory plugin today to free yourself from memory constraints.

    "short_description": "Get caching and more with this powerful cache plugin. Cache, optimize images, clean your database and minify for maximum performance.",
    "description": "<p>MORE THAN A CACHING PLUGIN</p>\n<p><strong>WP-Optimize is trusted by more than 1 million WordPress website</strong> owners to <strong>boost performance</strong> and <strong>reduce page load times</strong> to improve your site&#8217;s <strong>user experiences</strong> and <strong>SERP rankings in Google.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/333705073\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It does this in four clever ways:</p>\n<p><strong>1. It caches your site</strong></p>\n<p>Caching is the process of storing a temporary HTML version of your site on the server so it can be retrieved more quickly for the user.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a sure-fire way to ensure web pages load at lightning-fast speed. Turn it on in just one click.</p>\n<p><strong>2. It compresses images</strong></p>\n<p>Large images can really impact page speed load times. WP-Optimize makes it easy to identify and compress images to your preferred lossy / lossless settings in a couple of clicks.</p>\n<p><strong>3. It cleans the database</strong></p>\n<p>Your WordPress database stores everything that you need, plus some things that you don&#8217;t. WP-Optimize cleans and optimizes the database to speed up your site and save server resources.</p>\n<p><strong>4. It minifies</strong></p>\n<p>On top of its three main features, WP-Optimize Cache also has the more advanced minification feature.</p>\n<p>Together with caching, minification dramatically improves performance and page speed load time.</p>\n<h3>1. CACHE YOUR SITE</h3>\n<p><strong>Turn on caching in just one click:</strong></p>\n<p>WP-Optimize automatically and optimally configures itself for your WordPress site. Turn it on in one-click or refine its settings if you prefer.</p>\n<p><strong>More cache features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cache preloading:</strong> This feature emulates a visit to your site, meaning cached files are served straight away, speeding up your site from the very first visit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GZIP Compression:</strong> When the server isn&#8217;t configured to do so, WP-Optimize delivers HTML, CSS and JS files  to the user&#8217;s browser as smaller, compressed files, reducing the size of pages and style sheets by up to 90%!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preload key requests:</strong> Recommended by Google to improve page speed times. Critical resources (things like font files) get loaded first, so the page loads much faster <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use cache settings to:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Serve cached content to logged in users:</strong> Turn this on if content stays the same for logged in users (or turn on and exclude URLs where content does change e.g. my account areas).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exclude content from cache:</strong> Exclude by URL, conditional tags, browser agent strings or list cookies that should prevent caching when set (advanced user settings).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deliver device-specific cache:</strong> Serve separate cache files to desktop and mobile devices . This ensures that responsive features e.g. desktop and mobile menus are cached separately and served correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User per role cache:</strong> Useful if your website delivers different content to different user roles. e.g. an e-commerce site that displays different content to resellers or consumers <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User specific cache:</strong> Serves separate cache files to individual users. Useful for websites with personalised content e.g. Learning management systems <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cache purging permissions:</strong> Select which user roles are allowed to purge the cache e.g. admin only or perhaps a &#8216;teacher&#8217; role in an LMS setting only <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. COMPRESS IMAGES</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lossy or lossless compression options:</strong> Choose between maximum space saving, best image quality or somewhere in-between.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>WebP conversion:</strong> Recommended by Google, WebP can achieve up to 34% smaller file sizes compared to JPEG and up to 26% compared to PNG.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Auto-compress:</strong> Check a box and every new image you upload will automatically be compressed to your preferred lossy / lossless settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bulk compression:</strong> Compress every existing image on your site with the press of a button.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Restore original:</strong> Gone too far? Revert images back to their original in one click.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Retain EXIF image data:</strong> Check a box to retain EXIF image data during compression.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lazy Load:</strong> Webpages load much faster by loading web parts gradually, when they&#8217;re needed vs simultaneous loading of everything, all at once <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delete orphaned images:</strong> Identify and delete unused images from your WordPress website, saving disk space <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delete unused image sizes:</strong> WordPress creates multiple sizes for every uploaded image causing the uploads folder to become bloated. Scan for image sizes not in use and remove them to save further disk space <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. CLEAN AND OPTIMIZE THE DATABASE</h3>\n<p>Cleans-up database tables, post revisions, auto draft posts, trashed posts, spam, trashed comments and more. Choose what to optimize or it&#8217;s one click to clean out the lot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Schedule clean-ups:</strong> So you can set and forget. Choose from daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible clean-up schedules:</strong> You may wish to optimize database tables more frequently than you remove unapproved comments (for example). Choose the specific time and day when tasks should run <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Retain a set number of weeks&#8217; data during clean-ups:</strong> Just in case you need to retrieve something.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Back up before clean-ups:</strong> If you delete something you shouldn&#8217;t, restore it in a couple of clicks with UpdraftPlus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Power tweak &#8211; Turbo boost for WooCommerce:</strong>  Unique to WP-Optimize, this power tweak boosts performance by replacing a slow query in WooCommerce with two much more efficient queries. E-commerce sites transacting high numbers of orders stand to gain here <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Power tweak &#8211; Boost performance by indexing the postmeta table:</strong> This unique power tweak works by allowing the WordPress postmeta table to be indexed, improving performance <strong>[Premium]</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. MINIFY AND COMBINE HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Minify in just one click:</strong> Minifies HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Toggle on or off or customise each one under &#8216;settings&#8217;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customise minification:</strong> Minify only (removing unnecessary code e.g line breaks and white spacing) or minify and merge. Apply the same or different settings to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Asynchronous loading:</strong> Choose non-critical CSS and JavaScript files to load in the background and independently of other resources e.g. analytics or pixel scripts. Loading asynchronously eliminates render blocking and improves page speed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exclude files from being minified:</strong> Specify CSS and JavaScript files to exclude from minification.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimize fonts:</strong> Optimize Font Awesome and Google Fonts. Inline the font files, inherit from CSS settings or load CSS / Javascript asynchronously instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preload assets:</strong> WP-Optimize visits each web page on your site so the code is minified and preloaded for real life users, right from their very first visit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preload key requests:</strong> Recommended by Google to improve page speed times. Critical resources (things like font files) get loaded first, so the page loads much faster.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WHY WP-OPTIMIZE?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s brought to you by UpdraftPlus, the team behind the world&#8217;s most trusted backup, migration and restoration plugin.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s easy to use.</li>\n<li>It packs a punch for a free plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WP-Optimize brings the best cache and optimization technology together into one single, seamless plugin to make your WordPress site fast, lean and efficient.</p>\n<h3>PREMIUM FEATURES AT A GLANCE</h3>\n<p>Our free version of WP-Optimize Cache is great, but we also have an even more powerful Premium version with extra features that offer the ultimate in freedom and flexibility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multisite Support:</strong> extends database optimisations so they function for multiple WordPress sites at a time. If you manage more than one website, you will need WP-Optimize Cache Premium.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility and Control:</strong> gives you the power to optimize select individual tables or a particular combination of tables on one or more WordPress websites, rather than having to optimize all database tables.</li>\n<li><strong>Deleting unused and unwanted images:</strong> removes orphaned images from your WordPress site, plus images of a certain, pre-defined size.</li>\n<li><strong>Sophisticated Scheduling:</strong> offers a wide range of options for scheduling automatic optimization. Specify an exact time and run clean-ups daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly and perform any number of additional once off optimizations.</li>\n<li><strong>Seamless Graphical User Interface:</strong> for superb clarity in scheduling and managing of multi-site optimizations.</li>\n<li><strong>WP-CLI support:</strong> provides a way to manage optimizations from command-line interface if you have lots of sites</li>\n<li><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> load only the images and part of a web-page when it is visible to the user so they can see something very quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimization Preview:</strong> gives users the ability to preview, select and remove data and records available for optimization from the database.</li>\n<li><strong>Preload key requests:</strong> preload assets such as web fonts and icon fonts, as recommended by Google PageSpeed Insights.</li>\n<li><strong>Premium support</strong> &#8211; caching is one of the most complex things you can do for a website, so premium support offers you peace of mind there&#8217;s someone to talk quickly to if you need any technical answers or help configuring the optimizations of cache settings for your website.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>Translators are welcome to contribute to the plugin.

WebP is a file format that enables superior image compression and quality retention. All major performance testing solutions, including Google PageSpeed Insights, assess your site&#8217;s ability to serve images in these next-gen formats due to the significant impact on visitor experience.</p>\n<p><strong>WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPG images</strong>. More information can be found in <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/webp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this Google developers article</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The best part:</strong> Smush&#8217;s Local WebP feature makes this incredibly easy to set up with the ability to host all images locally (not requiring the use of a CDN). Our Local WebP feature includes automatically replacing PNG and JPEG images on your website&#8217;s frontend to serve WebP images &#8211; with the necessary fallbacks for browsers that don&#8217;t support WebP yet.</p>\n<p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://wpmudev.com/blog/serve-images-next-gen-formats-webp?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=smush-readme&amp;utm_content=wpmu_dev_blog_webp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How To Convert Images to WebP In WordPress</a></p>\n<p>Note: Yes, Smush supports WebP conversion for all image formats, including JPEG to WebP and PNG to WebP.</p>\n<p>With the best image optimization plugin for WordPress &#8211; you can finally stop worrying about the performance impact of using the images you want on your website.</p>\n<h3>Compress Images While Preserving Image Quality</h3>\n<p>Image compression plugins don&#8217;t have to destroy images with a visible, 30% loss in quality. Smush strips hidden information from your images (that can often be bulky), and reduces image file sizes without introducing a visible impact on appearance.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZJGq4zwf1A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>Smush meticulously scans every image you upload &#8211; or have already added to your site &#8211; cuts all the unnecessary data, and scales it for you before adding it to your media library. And it can serve images in the WebP format.</p>\n<h3>Compress Images While You Sleep With Background Image Optimization</h3>\n<p>Have a large number of images to compress? Smush’s powerful optimization features will continue to work their magic in the background, even when you’ve closed the plugin completely. You’ll receive an email when image optimization has been completed &#8211; with a full report.</p>\n<h3>Compress Any Image in Any Directory</h3>\n<p>As well as smushing your media uploads, you may want to compress the images stored in other folders. Smush now lets you compress any image in any directory &#8211; so that you can optimize all the images on your site &#8211; including <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/\" rel=\"ugc\">NextGEN</a> images, images stored on Amazon S3 using <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Offload Media</a> and images in EVERY WordPress plugin and theme package!</p>\n<h3>Compatible with Your Favorite Themes, Page Builders, and Media Library Plugins</h3>\n<p>No matter what theme or plugins you use to manage your WordPress media library, Smush has you covered.

    "short_description": "A very fast caching engine for WordPress that produces static html files.",
    "description": "<p>This plugin generates static html files from your dynamic WordPress blog.  After a html file is generated your webserver will serve that file instead of processing the comparatively heavier and more expensive WordPress PHP scripts.</p>\n<p>The static html files will be served to the vast majority of your users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users who are not logged in.</li>\n<li>Users who have not left a comment on your blog.</li>\n<li>Or users who have not viewed a password protected post.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>99% of your visitors will be served static html files. One cached file can be served thousands of times. Other visitors will be served custom cached files tailored to their visit. If they are logged in, or have left comments those details will be displayed and cached for them.</p>\n<p>The plugin serves cached files in 3 ways (ranked by speed):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Expert. The fastest method is by using Apache mod_rewrite (or whatever similar module your web server supports) to serve &#8220;supercached&#8221; static html files. This completely bypasses PHP and is extremely quick. If your server is hit by a deluge of traffic it is more likely to cope as the requests are &#8220;lighter&#8221;. This does require the Apache mod_rewrite module (which is probably installed if you have custom permalinks) and a modification of your .htaccess file which is risky and may take down your site if modified incorrectly.</li>\n<li>Simple. Supercached static files can be served by PHP and this is the recommended way of using the plugin. The plugin will serve a &#8220;supercached&#8221; file if it exists and it&#8217;s almost as fast as the mod_rewrite method. It&#8217;s easier to configure as the .htaccess file doesn&#8217;t need to be changed. You still need a custom permalink. You can keep portions of your page dynamic in this caching mode.</li>\n<li>WP-Cache caching. This is mainly used to cache pages for known users, URLs with parameters and feeds. Known users are logged in users, visitors who leave comments or those who should be shown custom per-user data. It&#8217;s the most flexible caching method and slightly slower. WP-Cache caching will also cache visits by unknown users if supercaching is disabled. You can have dynamic parts to your page in this mode too. This mode is always enabled but you can disable caching for known users, URLs with parameters, or feeds separately. Set the constant &#8220;DISABLE_SUPERCACHE&#8221; to 1 in your wp-config.php if you want to only use WP-Cache caching.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not comfortable with editing PHP files then use simple mode. It&#8217;s easy to set up and very fast.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Settings</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Simple caching.</li>\n<li>Compress pages.</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t cache pages for known users.</li>\n<li>Cache rebuild.</li>\n<li>CDN support.</li>\n<li>Extra homepage checks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Garbage collection is the act of cleaning up cache files that are out of date and stale. There&#8217;s no correct value for the expiry time but a good starting point is 1800 seconds.</p>\n<p>Consider deleting the contents of the &#8220;Rejected User Agents&#8221; text box and allow search engines to cache files for you.</p>\n<p>Preload as many posts as you can and enable &#8220;Preload Mode&#8221;. Garbage collection of old cached files will be disabled. If you don&#8217;t care about sidebar widgets updating often set the preload interval to 2880 minutes (2 days) so all your posts aren&#8217;t recached very often. When the preload occurs the cache files for the post being refreshed is deleted and then regenerated. Afterwards a garbage collection of all old files is performed to clean out stale cache files.<br />\nEven with preload mode enabled cached files will still be deleted when posts are modified or comments made.</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Active development of this plugin is handled <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on GitHub</a>.</li>\n<li>Translation of the plugin into different languages is on the <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-super-cache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">translation page</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>If you need more information than the following, you can have a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the wiki</a> or the <a href=\"https://odd.blog/wp-super-cache-developers/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Developer documentation</a>.</p>\n<h4>Preloading</h4>\n<p>You can generate cached files for the posts, categories and tags of your site by preloading. Preloading will visit each page of your site generating a cached page as it goes along, just like any other visitor to the site. Due to the sequential nature of this function, it can take some time to preload a complete site if there are many posts.<br />\nTo make preloading more effective it can be useful to disable garbage collection so that older cache files are not deleted. This is done by enabling &#8220;Preload Mode&#8221; in the settings. Be aware however, that pages will go out of date eventually but that updates by submitting comments or editing posts will clear portions of the cache.</p>\n<h4>Garbage Collection</h4>\n<p>Your cache directory fills up over time, which takes up space on your server. If space is limited or billed by capacity, or if you worry that the cached pages of your site will go stale then garbage collection has to be done. Garbage collection happens on a regular basis and deletes old files in the cache directory. On the advanced settings page you can specify:<br />\n1. Cache timeout. How long cache files are considered fresh for. After this time they are stale and can be deleted.<br />\n2. Scheduler. Setup how often garbage collection should be done.<br />\n3. Notification emails. You can be informed on garbage collection job progress.<br />\nThere&#8217;s no right or wrong settings for garbage collection. It depends on your own site.<br />\nIf your site gets regular updates, or comments then set the timeout to 1800 seconds, and set the timer to 600 seconds.<br />\nIf your site is mostly static you can disable garbage collection by entering 0 as the timeout, or use a really large timeout value.</p>\n<p>The cache directory, usually wp-content/cache/ is only for temporary files. Do not ever put important files or symlinks to important files or directories in that directory. They will be deleted if the plugin has write access to them.</p>\n<h4>CDN</h4>\n<p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is usually a network of computers situated around the world that will serve the content of your website faster by using servers close to you. Static files like images, Javascript and CSS files can be served through these networks to speed up how fast your site loads. You can also create a &#8220;poor man&#8217;s CDN&#8221; by using a sub domain of your domain to serve static files too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ossdl-cdn-off-linker/\" rel=\"ugc\">OSSDL CDN off-linker</a> has been integrated into WP Super Cache to provide basic CDN support. It works by rewriting the URLs of files (excluding .php files) in wp-content and wp-includes on your server so they point at a different hostname. Many CDNs support <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22origin+pull%22\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">origin pull</a>. This means the CDN will download the file automatically from your server when it&#8217;s first requested, and will continue to serve it for a configurable length of time before downloading it again from your server.</p>\n<p>Configure this on the &#8220;CDN&#8221; tab of the plugin settings page. This is an advanced technique and requires a basic understanding of how your webserver or CDNs work. Please be sure to clear the file cache after you configure the CDN.</p>\n<h4>REST API</h4>\n<p>There are now REST API endpoints for accessing the settings of this plugin. You&#8217;ll need to be authenticated as an admin user with permission to view the settings page to use it. This has not been documented yet but you can find all the code that deals with this in the &#8220;rest&#8221; directory.</p>\n<h4>Custom Caching</h4>\n<p>It is now possible to hook into the caching process using the add_cacheaction() function.</p>\n<p>Three hooks are available:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8216;wp_cache_get_cookies_values&#8217; &#8211; modify the key used by WP Cache.</li>\n<li>&#8216;add_cacheaction&#8217; &#8211; runs in phase2. Allows a plugin to add WordPress hooks.</li>\n<li>&#8216;cache_admin_page&#8217; &#8211; runs in the admin page. Use it to modify that page, perhaps by adding new configuration options.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is one regular WordPress filter too. Use the &#8220;do_createsupercache&#8221; filter<br />\nto customize the checks made before caching. The filter accepts one parameter.<br />\nThe output of WP-Cache&#8217;s wp_cache_get_cookies_values() function.</p>\n<p>WP Super Cache has its own plugin system. This code is loaded when WP Super Cache loads and can be used to change how caching is done. This is before most of WordPress loads so some functionality will not be available. Plugins can be located anywhere that PHP can load them. Add your own plugin either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>by putting your plugin in the wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache-plugins directory, or</li>\n<li>by calling wpsc_add_plugin( $name ) where $name is the full filename and path to the plugin. You only need to call that function once to add it. Use wpsc_delete_plugin( $name ) to remove it from the list of loaded plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cookies WP Super Cache uses to identify &#8220;known users&#8221; can be modified now by adding the names of those cookies to a list in the plugin configuration. Use wpsc_add_cookie( $name ) to add a new cookie, and wpsc_delete_cookie( $name ) to remove it. The cookie names also modify the mod_rewrite rules used by the plugin but I recommend using Simple mode caching to avoid complications with updating the .htaccess file.<br />\nThe cookie name and value are used to differenciate users so you can have one cookie, but different values for each type of user on your site for example. They&#8217;ll be served different cache files.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/blob/4cda5c0f2218e40e118232b5bf22d227fb3206b7/plugins/searchengine.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugins/searchengine.php</a> as an example I use for my <a href=\"https://odd.blog/no-adverts-for-friends/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">No Adverts for Friends</a> plugin.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<p>If things don&#8217;t work when you installed the plugin here are a few things to check:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is wp-content writable by the web server?</li>\n<li>Is there a wp-content/wp-cache-config.php ? If not, copy the file wp-super-cache/wp-cache-config-sample.php to wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and make sure WPCACHEHOME points at the right place.</li>\n<li>Is there a wp-content/advanced-cache.php ? If not, then you must copy wp-super-cache/advanced-cache.php into wp-content/. You must edit the file and change the path so it points at the wp-super-cache folder.</li>\n<li>If pages are not cached at all, remove wp-content/advanced-cache.php and recreate it, following the advice above.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure the following line is in wp-config.php and it is ABOVE the &#8220;require_once(ABSPATH.&#8217;wp-settings.php&#8217;);&#8221; line:</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'WP_CACHE', true );\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Try the Settings-&gt;WP Super Cache page again and enable cache.</li>\n<li>Look in wp-content/cache/supercache/. Are there directories and files there?</li>\n<li>Anything in your php error_log?</li>\n<li>If your browser keeps asking you to save the file after the super cache is installed you must disable Super Cache compression. Go to the Settings-&gt;WP Super Cache page and disable it there.</li>\n<li>The plugin does not work very well when PHP&#8217;s safe mode is active. This must be disabled by your administrator.</li>\n<li>If pages are randomly super cached and sometimes not, your blog can probably be viewed with and without the &#8220;www&#8221; prefix on the URL. You should choose one way and install the <a href=\"http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/enforce-www-preference/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Enforce www preference</a> plugin if you are using an old WordPress install. The latest versions redirect themselves (you should always be running the latest version of WordPress anyway!)</li>\n<li>Private Server users at Dreamhost should edit wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and set the cache dir to &#8220;/tmp/&#8221; if they are getting errors about increasing CPU usage. See this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/145895?replies=42\" rel=\"ugc\">discussion</a> for more.</li>\n<li>File locking errors such as &#8220;failed to acquire key 0x152b: Permission denied in&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Page not cached by WP Super Cache. Could not get mutex lock.&#8221; are a sign that you may have to use file locking. Edit wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and uncomment &#8220;$use_flock = true&#8221; or set $sem_id to a different value. You can also disable file locking from the Admin screen as a last resort.</li>\n<li>Make sure cache/wp_cache_mutex.lock is writable by the web server if using coarse file locking.</li>\n<li>The cache folder cannot be put on an NFS or Samba or NAS share. It has to be on a local disk. File locking and deleting expired files will not work properly unless the cache folder is on the local machine.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Garbage collection of old cache files won&#8217;t work if WordPress can&#8217;t find wp-cron.php. If your hostname resolves to 127.0.0.1 it could be preventing the garbage collection from working. Check your access_logs for wp-cron.php entries. Do they return a 404 (file not found) or 200 code? If it&#8217;s 404 or you don&#8217;t see wp-cron.php anywhere WordPress may be looking for that script in the wrong place. You should speak to your server administator to correct this or edit /etc/hosts on Unix servers and remove the following line. Your hostname must resolve to the external IP address other servers on the network/Internet use. See http://yoast.com/wp-cron-issues/ for more. A line like &#8220;127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain&#8221; is ok.</p>\n<pre><code>127.0.0.1 example.com\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>If old pages are being served to your visitors via the supercache, you may be missing Apache modules (or their equivalents if you don&#8217;t use Apache). 3 modules are required: mod_mime, mod_headers and mod_expires. The last two are especially important for making sure browsers load new versions of existing pages on your site.</li>\n<li>The error message, &#8220;WP Super Cache is installed but broken. The path to wp-cache-phase1.php in wp-content/advanced-cache.php must be fixed!&#8221; appears at the end of every page. Open the file wp-content/advanced-cache.php in your favourite editor. Is the path to wp-cache-phase1.php correct? This file will normally be in wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache/. If it is not correct the caching engine will not load.</li>\n<li>Caching doesn&#8217;t work. The timestamp on my blog keeps changing when I reload. Check that the path in your .htaccess rules matches where the supercache directory is. You may have to hardcode it. Try disabling supercache mode.</li>\n<li>\n<p>If supercache cache files are generated but not served, check the permissions on all your wp-content/cache/supercache folders (and each of wp-content cache and supercache folders) and wp-content/cache/.htaccess. If your PHP runs as a different user to Apache and permissions are strict Apache may not be able to read the PHP generated cache files. To fix you must add the following line to your wp-config.php (Add it above the WP_CACHE define.) Then clear your cache.</p>\n<pre><code>umask( 0022 );\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you see garbage in your browser after enabling compression in the plugin, compression may already be enabled in your web server. In Apache you must disable mod_deflate, or in PHP zlib compression may be enabled. You can disable that in three ways. If you have root access, edit your php.ini and find the zlib.output_compression setting and make sure it&#8217;s &#8220;Off&#8221; or add this line to your .htaccess:</p>\n<pre><code>php_flag zlib.output_compression off\n</code></pre>\n<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work, add this line to your wp-config.php:</p>\n<pre><code>ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 0);\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>The &#8220;white screen of death&#8221; or a blank page  when you visit your site is almost always caused by a PHP error but <a href=\"http://www.johnberns.com/2010/03/19/wp-super-cache-blank-page-problem-fixed/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">it may also be caused by APC</a>. Disable that PHP extension if you have trouble and replace with eAccelerator or Xcache.</li>\n<li>After uninstalling, your permalinks may break if you remove the WordPress mod_rewrite rules too. Regenerate those rules by visiting the Settings-&gt;Permalink page and saving that form again.</li>\n<li>If your blog refuses to load make sure your wp-config.php is correct. Are you missing an opening or closing PHP tag?</li>\n<li>Your front  &hellip;</li>\n</ol>\n",

As a developer I appreciate how fast, modern, clean and extensible it is.<br />\n  Bill Erickson &#8211; Expert WordPress Consultant</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Pre-built Form Templates</h4>\n<p>WPForms comes with <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/templates/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">2000+ pre-built form templates</a>.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking to create a simple contact form, marketing form, request a quote form, donation form, payment order form, registration form, Stripe payment form, or a subscription form, we have a form template already prepared and ready to use.</p>\n<h4>Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly, and Optimized for Speed</h4>\n<p>WPForms contact forms are 100% responsive and mobile-friendly. We optimized every query on the frontend and the backend to ensure that it&#8217;s one of the fastest WordPress contact form plugins.</p>\n<p>You can embed your contact form on any page with an optimized title and description, so WPForms is one of the most SEO friendly contact form plugins too.</p>\n<h4>Fields &amp; Features You Need to Succeed</h4>\n<p>With star ratings, file uploads, repeater fields, survey fields, and multi-page contact forms, you can easily build the right custom form for your site&#8217;s needs. Plus, integrate your contact forms with an email marketing service in just a few steps and collect payments with Stripe, PayPal, and Square for bookings and orders without the need for a dedicated eCommerce plugin.</p>\n<p>See what one business owner has to say about their WPForms contact form:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a business owner, time is my most valuable asset. WPForms allows me to create smart contact forms with just a few clicks. With their pre-built form templates and the drag &amp; drop builder, I can create a new form that works in less than 2 minutes without writing a single line of code. Well worth the investment.<br />\n  David Henzel &#8211; Co-founder of MaxCDN</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Surveys &amp; Polls</h4>\n<p>Create custom survey forms like Survey Monkey. Our <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/features/surveys-and-polls-addon?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress survey plugin addon</a> comes with smart survey fields including Likert scale, star ratings, and NPS. Embed your surveys and polls anywhere in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Use our survey reporting tools to customize graphs, export them for presentations, and display aggregate results. You can also share poll results instantly when collecting votes.</p>\n<h4>Default WordPress Forms</h4>\n<p>Aside from building simple contact forms, WPForms also helps you create better default WordPress forms, like custom WordPress login forms and custom WordPress user registration forms. Create a password-protected contact form or even a members-only contact form.</p>\n<p>Bloggers and publishers can use our WordPress post submission forms to accept guest posts, testimonials, and more.</p>\n<h4>Payment Forms, Donation Forms, Booking Forms, and More</h4>\n<p>While WPForms started out as a contact form plugin, it has evolved into a powerful custom forms solution for any type of payment or booking form.</p>\n<p>WPForms integrates with PayPal, Stripe, Square Payments, and Authorize.Net so you can easily accept credit card payments or take payments via PayPal. Bonus: you can also take signatures.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re proud to be a Stripe Verified Partner. This partnership allows us to build the best Stripe integration with early access to features. You can use our Stripe integration to accept both one-time payments as well as recurring payments while syncing all form data to your Stripe account.</p>\n<h4>Custom Calculator Forms</h4>\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/features/calculations-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPForms Calculations addon</a>, you can build custom formulas and display results on the frontend.</p>\n<p>Create simple arithmetic calculations or build complex conditional calculations with rounded values, averages, time ranges, and more! It&#8217;s the best calculator plugin for WordPress.</p>\n<h4>Forms Optimized for Conversions</h4>\n<p>With our Form Pages addon, you can create distraction-free custom form landing pages to increase conversions.</p>\n<p>To improve form completion rates, we created Conversational Forms which helps you make your feedback forms feel more human by adding an interactive layout. (<a href=\"https://wpforms.com/features/conversational-forms-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See Conversational Forms Demo</a>).</p>\n<h4>Easy to Customize and Extend</h4>\n<p>You can easily customize your contact forms with our section dividers, HTML blocks, and CSS. Embedding forms in Elementor and Divi has never been easier thanks to our native integrations.</p>\n<p>We also know that our developer friends may want more control, so we added tons of hooks and filters.</p>\n<h4>Full WPForms Feature List</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/features/drag-drop-online-form-builder/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Online form builder</a> &#8211; powerful drag &amp; drop contact form builder.

    "description": "<h4>English</h4>\n<p><em>WPS Hide Login</em> is a very light plugin that lets you easily and safely change the url of the login form page to anything you want. It doesn’t literally rename or change files in core, nor does it add rewrite rules. It simply intercepts page requests and works on any WordPress website. The wp-admin directory and wp-login.php page become inaccessible, so you should bookmark or remember the url. Deactivating this plugin brings your site back exactly to the state it was before.</p>\n<p>This plugin is kindly proposed by <a href=\"https://www.wpserveur.net/?refwps=14&amp;campaign=wpshidelogin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPServeur</a> the specialized WordPress web host.</p>\n<p>Discover also our other free extensions:<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wps-limit-login/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPS Limit Login</a> to block brute force attacks.<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wps-bidouille/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPS Bidouille</a> to optimize your WordPress and get more info.<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wps-cleaner/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPS Cleaner</a> to clean your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This plugin is only maintained, which means we do not guarantee free support. Consider reporting a problem and be patient.</p>\n<h4>Français</h4>\n<p><em>WPS Hide Login</em> est un plugin très léger qui vous permet de changer facilement et en toute sécurité l&#8217;url de la page de formulaire de connexion. Il ne renomme pas littéralement ou ne modifie pas les fichiers dans le noyau, ni n&#8217;ajoute des règles de réécriture. Il intercepte simplement les demandes de pages et fonctionne sur n&#8217;importe quel site WordPress. Le répertoire wp-admin et la page wp-login.php deviennent inaccessibles, vous devez donc ajouter un signet ou vous souvenir de l&#8217;URL. Désactiver ce plugin ramène votre site exactement à l&#8217;état dans lequel il était auparavant.</p>\n<p>Ce plugin vous est gentiment proposé par <a href=\"https://www.wpserveur.net/?refwps=14&amp;campaign=wpshidelogin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPServeur</a> l&#8217;hébergeur spécialisé WordPress.</p>\n<p>Plus d&#8217;infos sur son utilisation : <a href=\"https://wpformation.com/wps-hide-login-url-connexion-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://wpformation.com/wps-hide-login-url-connexion-wordpress/</a></p>\n<p>Découvrez également nos autres extensions gratuites :<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/wps-limit-login/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPS Limit Login</a> pour bloquer les attaques par force brute.<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/wps-bidouille/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPS Bidouille</a> pour optimiser votre WordPress et faire le plein d&#8217;infos.<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/wps-cleaner/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPS Cleaner</a> pour nettoyer votre site WordPress.</p>\n<p>Ce plugin est seulement maintenu, ce qui signifie que nous ne garantissons pas un support gratuit. Envisagez de signaler un problème et soyez patient.</p>\n<h4>Compatibility</h4>\n<h4>English</h4>\n<p>Requires WordPress 4.1 or higher. All login related things such as the registration form, lost password form, login widget and expired sessions just keep working.</p>\n<p>It’s also compatible with any plugin that hooks in the login form, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BuddyPress,</li>\n<li>bbPress,</li>\n<li>Jetpack,</li>\n<li>WPS Limit Login,</li>\n<li>and User Switching.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously it doesn’t work with plugins or themes that <em>hardcoded</em> wp-login.php.</p>\n<p>Works with multisite, with subdomains and subfolders. Activating it for a network allows you to set a networkwide default. Individual sites can still rename their login page to something else.</p>\n<p>If you’re using a <strong>page caching plugin</strong> other than WP Rocket, you should add the slug of the new login url to the list of pages not to cache. WP Rocket is already fully compatible with the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Français</h4>\n<p>Nécessite WordPress 4.1 ou supérieur. Toutes les choses liées à la connexion telles que le formulaire d&#8217;inscription, le formulaire de mot de passe perdu, le widget de connexion et les sessions expirées continuent de fonctionner.</p>\n<p>Il est également compatible avec tout plugin qui se connecte au formulaire de connexion, notamment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BuddyPress,</li>\n<li>bbPress,</li>\n<li>Jetpack,</li>\n<li>WPS Limit Login,</li>\n<li>and User Switching.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Évidemment, cela ne fonctionne pas avec les plugins ou les thèmes <em>hardcoded</em> wp-login.php.</p>\n<p>Fonctionne en multisite, avec sous-domaines ou sous dossiers. L&#8217;activer pour un réseau vous permet de définir une valeur par défaut pour l&#8217;ensemble du réseau. Les sites individuels peuvent toujours renommer leur page de connexion pour autre chose.</p>\n<p>Si vous utilisez un <strong>plugin de mise en cache de pages</strong> autre que WP Rocket, vous devez ajouter le slug de la nouvelle URL de connexion à la liste des pages à ne pas mettre en cache. WP Rocket est déjà entièrement compatible avec le plugin.</p>\n",

If you need more control, there is a developer-friendly way to include/exclude products programmatically.</li>\n<li>Hide out of stock products from the feed, or products on backorder.</li>\n<li>Choose between long and short descriptions for product display.
